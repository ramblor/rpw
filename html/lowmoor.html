    </h3>

    <p><span class="title">The Book of Lowmoor</span> is a fantasy trilogy designed to be enjoyed by readers from 10 to
        110.</p>

    <p>Volume one, <span class="title">Jewel and Thorn</span>, was published in February 2005.</p>

    <p>Volume two, now in preparation, is entitled <span class="title">The Brass Key</span>.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>In a world of decaying structures built by a giant but vanished race, haunted tracts of waste land and vast,
        forbidding forests, lives a race of six- to seven-inch tall human beings.</p>

    <p>Most people dwell in walled settlements, surviving through a mixture of hunting, agriculture and trade, breeding
        and training rats for riding, haulage and heavy work. Others live in isolated, eccentric communities. Some,
        little more than savages, obey no laws but their own. A few rich eccentrics inhabit giant houses or mansions
        scattered through the landscape.</p>

    <p>Few people travel outside the security of their own walls. Exceptions are pedlars, traders and merchants; Ranters
        - itinerant preachers; and entertainers, who like the first group move from fair to fair.</p>

    <p><span class="title">The Book of Lowmoor</span> tells the story of two young people whose separate quests draw
        them into unexpected dangers and encounters, and closer to the secret of why their world is the way it is.</p>

    <p><span class="title">The Book of Lowmoor</span> is published by
