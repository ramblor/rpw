        In this unusual memoir of his first eleven years, Richard Poole writes about his family, friends and early schooling in what he recalls as an idyllic semi-urban, 
        semi-rural setting. It was an area he roamed, alone or with friends, with a freedom almost unknown to twenty-first century British children, and one he came to know 
        like the back of his hand. As a result, the environment of the village with its streets, shops, park, lakes, reservoir, fields, farms and woodlands emerges virtually as 
        a character in its own right - a character now dead and gone after the old village was demolished around 1970.

        Whilst the major part of <span class="title">Low Moor Lad</span> is written in prose, this book also contains the poem sequence 'Childhood sonnets'. It closes with a poem expressing the shock 
        the author felt on first encountering, unprepared, the ruins of the village he knew and loved.
