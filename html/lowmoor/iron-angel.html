            In Lowmoor settlement Jewel and Thorn discover a conspiracy which threatens everything they know, and which they alone can thwart. In order to enhance already remarkable powers, Querne Rasp seeks to complete her own collection of crystals and wield the five-stone crystal star, with its dark vortex. Meanwhile, the enigmatic Racky Jagger approaches a crisis 
            of his own&hellip;</br>
            </br>
            Jewel and Thorn's most dangerous quest yet takes them into a ruined giant ironworks where a fanatical tribe of humans wages unending war on rats. Then on to a Dark Time church inhabited by a sinister cult. And finally into the bowels of the church, where their courage and ingenuity will be tested to the limit.

        <p class="review">
            "The writing is refreshing, with characters that you just can't fail to hook into. Making this a wonderful read for a child of any age (and it really took me back to mine wishing I had this then.) Great stuff with a great angle and a wonderful world to explore tied up with a killer plot. How does Richard manage it?"<br/>

            "&hellip;the environment in which&hellip; Jewel and Thorn exist is a long way from fairyland, and though there is what might seem to be magic involved, it is more a matter of the development of innate psychic abilities than of wand waving and spells&hellip; There are some fine villains - Higgins Makepeace, fanatical leader of a death-cult. Querne Rasp, witch and would-be global tyrant - while the Ranter Manningham Sparkes stands firmly for decency and tolerance&hellip; Perhaps the most sustained flight of imagination&hellip; is Jewel and Thorn's final journey to confront Querne Rasp in her underground maze, a terrifying labyrinth of ice spiders and man-eating plants."<br/>
