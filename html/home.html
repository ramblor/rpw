    <p class="review">
        "There are so many excellent trilogies around at the moment, it's nice to find something outstanding, and Richard Poole's <i>Lowmoor</i> trilogy is just that. 
        <i>Jewel and Thorn</i> conjures up visions of a Middle Ages world, but the fantasy elements add an ingredient that makes the book really satisfying and totally original."<br />
