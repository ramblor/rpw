I have published five collections of poetry: <span class="title">Goings and other poems</span>,  (1978), <span class="title">Words before Midnight</span> (1981), <span class="title">Natural Histories</span> (1989), <span class="title">Autobiographies and Explorations</span> (1994) and <span class="title">Camelion</span>, (2012). Also a selection of translations from the twentieth century Welsh poetry T. H. Parry-Williams entitled <span class="title">That Fool July</span>. Pursue the links to read a poem taken from each book together with extracts from reviews.

        A <span class="title">Criticism</span> section will in the future reproduce some of the literary essays that I've written over the years.
        There will be a large section on Richard Hughes, and individual essays on Philip Pullman, Thomas Harris,
        Vladimir Nabokov and many poets including Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas and R. S. Thomas.
