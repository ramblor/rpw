            class="title">Jewel and Thorn</span>, is now out from Simon & Schuster, and is available from bookshops
        and on the web. For information on the trilogy, including background and early reviews, click on the

        My five books of poems are listed under the <a href="poetry">Poetry</a> section. Each collection is
        represented by one poem and extracts from contemporary reviews.

        The <a href="criticism">Criticism</a> section will in the future reproduce some of the literary essays that I've written over the years.
        There will be a large section on Richard Hughes, and individual essays on Philip Pullman, Thomas Harris,
        Vladimir Nabokov and many poets including Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas and R. S. Thomas.

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
