    <h4>Introduction</h4>

    <p>
        Richard Hughes was born in Caterham, Surrey, in 1900 and died in North Wales in 1976. He wrote only four novels, but on the strength of these novels acquired an enormous reputation in his lifetime. Two were published before the second world war and two after it.

        His first novel, <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>, came out in 1929 (1928 in the U. S. A. as <span class="title">The Innocent Voyage</span>) and was a best seller and hugely controversial. It challenged the Romantic and Victorian notion of the child as innocent <i>tabula rasa</i>, presenting children instead as a brave post-Darwinian species engaged in a life and death struggle for survival. When a number of children are captured by a bunch of latter-day nineteenth-century pirates, it is the children who turn out the more dangerous of the two groups.

        Hughes's second novel, <span class="title">In Hazard</span>, appeared in 1938. The story of a ship and its crew caught up in a tremendous hurricane, it is based on a real-life event. Only after he had published the book did Hughes himself perceive its subtext: a symbolic anticipation of the physical upheaval of the second world war, it embodies the virtues individuals would need to demonstrate if they were to survive the challenge presented by the war.

        After the war, during which he worked as a civil servant in the navy procurement office, Hughes embarked on a serial novel of his own life and times entitled <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>. This was an ambitious attempt to trace and account for the rise and defeat of German National Socialism. Two volumes were completed: <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span> (1961) and <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> (1973). Twelve chapters of a third volume were drafted, and are now included in reprints of <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span>. In these books, Hughes deftly interweaves the lives of fictional characters and actual historical figures - most notably Adolf Hitler himself. Hughes's hero, Augustine Penry-Herbert, was like Hughes himself born in 1900, but whilst he shares many of Hughes's own life-experiences, his character is very different.

        Although he wrote only four novels (perhaps as a result of only writing four!), Hughes lived a full and vivid life. He also wrote poems, plays, short stories, film-scripts and an assortment of journalistic pieces. There is an authoritative biography of him entitled <span class="title">Richard Hughes</span>, by Richard Perceval Graves (Andre Deutsch), and a critical biography of him by Richard Poole, <span class="title">Richard Hughes - Novelist</span> (Poetry Wales Press). Richard Poole has edited some of his literary writings under the title <i>Fiction as Truth: Selected Literary Writings by Richard Hughes</i>  (Poetry Wales Press) and a selection of his Moroccan stories entitled <span class="title">In the Lap of Atlas</span> (Chatto &amp; Windus). There is a pioneering monograph by Peter Thomas in the Writers of Wales series, and a significant study of Hughes's work by Paul Morgan: <span class="title">The Art of Richard Hughes</span> (University of Wales Press). Two of Hughes's five children, Penelope (<span class="title">Richard Hughes: Author, Father</span> and <span class="title">Crab's Odyssey</span> - the second under her married name of Penny Minney) and Owain (<span class="title">Everything I Have Always Forgotten</span>), have written memoirs which include fascinating insights on their father.
