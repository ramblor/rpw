            My aim in this essay is to examine the aesthetics of Richard Hughes's second novel <span class="title">In Hazard</span>. I'm well aware that my approach is only one of a number of possibilities (a fascinating alternative would consider the relationship of this "fiction" to the remarkable voyage of the S.S. <span class="title">Phemius</span> on which it is based), but it is one, I believe, that can attempt some account of what it is like <i>actually to read</i> this novel, to respond to the words on the page: for Richard Hughes's two pre-war novels are among that small number of narrative prose-works possessed of the power to induce in a responsive reader what Vladimir Nabokov somewhere calls "aesthetic bliss". Of course, any given literary work is unlikely to prove the same experience for any two of its readers—and may indeed provide a different experience for the same reader each time he reads it. That this is true has not, apparently, deterred the majority of contemporary critics and commentators from their labours, for (amongst other things) our age is notoriously one in which interpretation has proliferated to an alarming degree. What has to be said, however, is that the condition of delight which <span class="title">In Hazard</span> (or <span class="title">Lolita</span>) can induce in a reader is as much a part of the novel's conveyed <i>meaning</i> (tricksy word, but it must suffice) as is that network of semantic significances to which the translating intellect reduces it upon sober reflection, and to which it gives the name of <i>understanding</i>: and this delight demands acknowledgement because it articulates a quality that excogitation does not seek to duplicate—the quality of immediacy, a spontaneity uncompromised by the wily and insidious dealings of discursive rationality. And yet, even as I say this. I am compelled to admit (and it is reason compels the admission) that this state of pure delight is one which the critical essayist is no more likely ever to do justice to than he is likely wholly to evade the subtle deceits that analytical thought can urge upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
            In October l92l Richard Hughes sat down to fulfil a long-promised threat—to send his friend Mrs Amabel Williams-Ellis (later Lady Williams-Ellis) "some sort of poetic Athanasian creed". The omens were favourable—he had a stomach-ache: only when suffering from this particular complaint, he told her, could he manage writing demanding sustained effort. He was lucky: the stomach-ache held up so well that it produced a creed some six thousand words long—a creed of a substantiality more than sufficient to provide a way of looking at my subject. My discussion falls, then. into two related parts: (1) an outline of those aspects of Hughes's creed that seem germane to my aesthetical concerns; and (2) an investigation of <span class="title">In Hazard</span> in the light of that creed. Before I go on to the letter itself, however, a couple of preliminary points demand to be made.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, the author of this creed was in only his twenty-second year. Should we expect a  coherent, rounded, original literary philosophy from one so young? Hughes himself remarks with self-deprecating good humour that at times he's secretly convinced that his credos are entirely wrong; also that in six months they may well be heresies. Later he admits that what he says is "not particularly original". Should we be troubled by these comments? I don't myself think it matters whether a theory is original or familiar: what we demand is that it issue in good literature. Certainly the bare holding of a theory may or may not co-exist with the talent, or genius, necessary successfully and memorably to embody it. Nor does it much matter whether it be "wrong" or "right", or, since these are dubious terms to apply in such a context, crazy or sane. (Apparently crazy notions have in the past gone into the making of fine poems.) In point of fact Hughes's ideas seem to me both workable and sane. As to whether they had become heresies by the time of writing of <span class="title">In Hazard</span>: well, we must sample the pudding in order to judge whether or not the blend of its ingredients is in accordance with the recipe. Certainly—and the adjectives are Hughes's own—his terminology can be "obscure" and his argument is at times "rude" and "disorderly". I have to hope then (though this is the burden of any literary commentator) that I've sinned against the spirit neither of the writer's individual terms nor overall argument.
        </p>
        <p>
            My second preliminary point turns on the title of this essay: not 'the theory and practice of <i>novel-writing</i>', but of <i>art</i>. Hughes's letter begins with some general reflections on art in its widest sense, but when talking about that branch of art we call literature it is <i>poetry</i> he usually chooses to discuss. Nowhere, in fact, does he so much as mention the words 'novel' or 'novelist'. Here, then, is where I must commit myself to a crucial statement: the author of <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> and <span class="title">In Hazard</span> is a poet who writes novels. I mean this in the sense that one may call Shakespeare a poet who wrote plays—a dramatic poet rather than a poetic dramatist. Hughes's vision, and the ways in which he manipulates the novel-form in order to articulate that vision, are essentially a poet's. Robert Graves, a friend and contemporary of Hughes, is a poet who writes novels in a very different, and instructively different sense. Graves and Hughes disagreed fundamentally over the relationship of poetry to novel-writing. Graves regarded novel-writing as a separate discipline from poetry-writing and a very inferior one—a secular bread-and-butter affair; Hughes, however, saw no reason why the full resources of the poet shouldn't be drafted into the novel. Graves wrote poetry and novels, side by side, for a lifetime; Hughes wrote no more poems after beginning <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> in 1925. Yet his poetic ability was not put to one side, did not diminish: rather it blossomed. Often in the verse of his youth—and all his verse is juvenilia—I sense an artificiality, a constriction, whether of rhythm, or of phrasing, or of conception. In prose. paradoxically. Hughes was able to find the verbal space, the essential conditions, his particular poet's sensibility required. No doubt it's true that he was realizing, in the mid-1920's, a comparative maturity, and this coincided with his determination to write a novel. Yet I'm inclined to believe that he matured at least partly <i>because</i> he had decided to embark on a novel. The seriousness of the undertaking inspired a new depth of engagement in him.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it's time to turn to the letter, to the creed itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Art is not imitative", Hughes begins, "it is creative: creative of beauty". I'm not concerned here to investigate the sources or analogues of these notions, my brief does not allow; what I want to emphasize is their thoroughgoing aestheticism—a term I wield in no pejorative sense. The business of the artist. Hughes asserts, is in the first place neither to teach his reader nor to provoke his emotion (though the reader will be taught and his emotion provoked)—unless, that is, the aesthetic activity itself is an emotion. In so far as human beings who don't practise art appreciate art they too, to that degree, are artists. Beauty, like goodness, is a quality of the human mind. In itself the universe is neither beautiful nor ugly, good nor bad: it's the perceiving sensibility that makes it so. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What then constitutes this beauty? "Beauty seems to be a kind of rhythm." And Hughes underscores a sentence one finds repeatedly in his later, post-1945 discussions of art and rhetoric: "<i>Man is a pattern-making animal</i>". "Pattern", he says, "is a crude form of rhythm, a skeleton of rhythm. Perhaps it would be better to say that Man is a rhythm-making animal." <i>Rhythm</i> is clearly preferred to <i>pattern</i> here: elsewhere in the letter these terms are not so strongly distinguished, nor which is preferable so forcefully expressed. <i>Pattern</i> is a term familiar enough in twentieth century novel-criticism. The marxist critic Arnold Kettle begins his book on the English Novel by suggesting that "there are in all novels which are successful works of art two elements": "life" and "pattern". The first of these is vague, for no adequate synonym is found for it: novels that possess "life" are "life-communicating", convey a "sense of life" which quickens our faculties. As for the second, "pattern":<br/>
            <br/>
            "Pattern is not something narrowly 'aesthetic', something which critics like Clive Bell used to talk about as 'form' (as opposed to life or content). Pattern is the quality in a book which gives it wholeness and meaning, makes the reading of it a complete and satisfying experience."<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Kettle's problem, and one he's well aware of, is that these elements "are not, in truth, separable"<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>; the great writer perceives life <i>in terms of</i> pattern, imposes a vision upon it which rescues it from chaos and gives it significance. Yet Kettle, like so many literary critics after him (and I cannot myself have escaped this pitfall), is compelled to proceed as if, to some extent, life and pattern are separable entities. Hughes's preference for the term <i>rhythm</i> may be seen as his attempt to circumvent the dualism of form and content. Rhythm is that quality which imbues all the elements of a successful work of literature and binds them together. It may be found in a poem on all its "levels"—at once regulating the speed at which successive individual words enter a reader's consciousness, and governing the interplay of sounds, images, and themes. It is <i>because</i> the raw material of literature can be perceived, in these various ways, as rhythms, that the successful work can finally be produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which brings me to those elements which in works of art exist imbued by rhythm. In music, clearly, rhythm will be a corollary of certain configurations of notes, since (at least up to the advent of the school of Schoenberg) musical structure is based upon the principles of repetition and variation; in plastic art it will reveal itself through significant form; in literature through what Hughes, leaning on the Greek word έιδολον [eidolon], calls "idea-images". This is, as might be expected, a very general term. An idea-image can be anything produced by intellectual-imaginative activity, is "whatever it is that the mind <i>does</i>, makes". If the materials of the plastic artist are shapes and colours, those of the poet are "sensual images, emotions, conceptions". Idea-images then vary in kind from those in which the element of image is, metaphorically-speaking, "uppermost"—where what is presented is a definite sensory image—down through weaker gradations of image to those in which the element of idea is uppermost—where what is purveyed is a pure abstraction. The idea-image with the fullest capacity for life is one that simultaneously incites sensual and intellectual responses in a reader.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three things, says Hughes, are essential to the good poem: individually the idea-images must be vivid and quickening; second, they must be organized into an orderly, satisfying whole by a governing "rhythmic conception"; and finally "the conception of rhythm in all these dimensions must be influenced by their own interplay". A few years later in 1925, in a review, Hughes found these aesthetic essentials in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>.<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> The review begins: "To the poet the visible world exists: it shines with an intense brilliance, not only to the eye but to the touch, ear, smell, inward vision" (words that tempt one to apply them to the opening chapter of <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i>). What especially exists in Mrs. Dalloway—what, the implication is, makes Virginia Woolf a poet of the novel—is London, which Hughes finds "emerges shining like crystal, out of the fog in which all the merely material universe is ordinarily enveloped in his mind: it emerges, and stays". Here, if we wish to see it, is a gloss on Hughes's earlier assertion that art is "creative" rather than "imitative". A brief excursion into philosophy will give depth to the point. The Scottish philosopher David Hume divides human perceptions into two distinct kinds. To "sensations, passions, emotions" he gives the name "impressions". To "the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning" he gives the title "ideas". Ideas themselves are of two kinds: of imagination or of memory. Between these again he asserts a difference to lie, ideas of memory possessing a greater degree of vivacity than ideas of imagination.<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            When Hume comes to consider how imagination is employed in poetry he continues to maintain that poetic ideas ("poetical fictions") differ from ideas belonging to memory or judgment in the comparative weakness or imperfectness of the feelings they engender.<a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Imagination, then consists in <i>having</i> (seeing, hearing, tasting, etc.) weak experiences".<a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> Richard Hughes inverts Hume's teaching: for him an artist cannot be truly creative unless he or she has the ability to invest objects with a vividness, a paradoxical reality, that they lack in objective perception or in memory. The images created by one human imagination for another may evoke feelings more intense than those feelings stimulated in us by the outside world. Thus he can assert: "To Mrs. Woolf London exists, and to Mrs. Woolf's readers anywhere and at any time London will exist with a reality it can never have for those who merely live there". Yet, even when so much is allowed, this brilliance, this vividness isn't in itself enough: "it is only the material of art". The further essential is an organisational faculty capable of shaping the individual images into a satisfying whole; but this too Virginia Woolf possesses, so that Hughes can say: "it is not by its vividness that her writing ultimately stays in the mind, but by the coherent and processional form which is composed of, and transcends, that vividness". <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, then, possesses those rhythmic qualities without which for Hughes literature cannot be considered to be art.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's time now to turn to <span class="title">In Hazard</span>. Can we discern in this novel the three interconnecting qualities Richard Hughes believed essential to the successful work of art?
        </p>
        <p>
            The question it seems natural to ask first is this: What, if anything, constitutes the governing rhythmic principle of the book, what is the unifying power to which all the individual elements are subordinate and in which they all inhere? Let me postpone my answer for a while. In his letter Hughes says that "one of the most prevalent forms of mental pattern is the relation of something or other to a symbol". In his Introduction to the American edition of <span class="title">In Hazard</span> of 1966 he develops his notion of poetic symbol. He starts from the premise that the writing of poetry does for the poet what dreaming does for other people: "it allows a safe outlet for conflicts and tensions too painful for his conscious mind to face, disguised so impenetrably in symbol that the poet himself has no inkling of what his poem is really 'about'—just as the dreamer has none till his analyst tells him".<a href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The essential factor here is the poet's ignorance of the deeper significance of what he's saying—his symbol must be <i>subconscious</i>, hence a quite different matter from conscious allegory. Frequently in his writings Hughes asserts that a writer should write only when compelled to do so by an inner force he can't deny. Opposing those critics (Robert Graves amongst them) who deny that prose is as deeply rooted in its creator's imaginative being as poetry is, Hughes asks: "Why must the novelist's compulsion be assumed to differ in kind from the poet's?" The force of this will readily be admitted: to take an obvious instance, consider the writings of Kafka. <span class="title">In Hazard</span> was very much a book that insisted on being written—indeed another one, half-done, was put aside in order to make way for it and never resumed. And this was in the thirties when, Hughes believed, "Reason" forbade the British consciously to recognize the brutal political realities under their very noses. So, the text of <span class="title">In Hazard</span> is interpolated with what look like clues. On its opening page Hughes's narrator sees "what appeared to be my Prime Minister, in a suit of overalls, crawling out of a piece of dismantled machinery with an air of real authority and knowledge and decision" (p. 3).<a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The politician Ramsay MacDonald. of course, died at sea in November 1937—on a voyage to South America!) Then the narrator tells us that when its "guys were properly set up, that funnel was as safe as the Bank of England." (p. 4). Later, discussing the behaviour of hurricanes, he quips: "Ships (which can run) are safer in those latitudes than government offices (which cannot)." (p. 33). The name of the Captain, Edwardes, suggests those of a series of English kings—the last, by choice, a brief incumbent. And the salvage vessel at the end of the story is American. But no, we are not to simplify matters: <span class="title">In Hazard</span> isn't an allegory or a prophecy: it presents us with symbols, and if we wish to speculate we must take our cues from this pronouncement, one as elusive as any Hughes ever made: "symbol (in the dream sense) is never concerned primarily with the future <i>qua</i> future but with a much more timeless kind of truth".<a href="#note9"><sup>9</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            When in 1933 he heard (from Mrs Williams-Ellis. as it happens) of the epic struggle of the S.S. <i>Phemius</i> with a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea, Hughes testifies to the fact that he became "obsessed"<a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a> by the event. The twin symbols of ship and storm gained an inexplicably powerful hold upon his imagination. His poet's sensibility must have been quick to appreciate the pattern discernible in their prolonged encounter. Here then is my answer to the question I posed earlier: the governing rhythmic principle of the book is to be discovered in the conflict between the simultaneously real and symbolic entities of ship and weather: <i>Archimedes</i> and its human crew on the one hand, the hurricane and the maddened sea on the other. The book doesn't of course begin in storm, but it's not long before we see in retrospect that those early pages about the ship's design, workings and crew were all given in anticipation of the tremendous struggle that was to ensue. The novel begins in calm, we sense the gathering swell, then comes the full onslaught that rips the tarpaulins off the hatches and plucks out the funnel; the rhythm of the main part of the book is one of alternating buffetings and lulls as <i>Archimedes</i> is first pushed into the centre, then sucked back again into the maelstrom, pushed in and sucked out again. Only when she is at last spewed out in the hurricane's rear does, upon exhausted sailors and readers alike, some semblance of comparative calm descend. It's here that I can with propriety counter those reviewers of 1938 who found that <span class="title">In Hazard</span> petered out inconclusively, even frivolously.<a href="#note11"><sup>11</sup></a> The aesthetic symmetry of the novel makes ii proper that it should close on a crippled ship limping in tow to port through a gradually diminishing swell. To enter upon the Sage Line's verdict upon Captain Edwardes's handling of his vessel (the suggested continuation) would be to embark upon a fresh sea of conflict, to introduce a distinct rhythmic element—and the balance of the tale would be impaired. The Sage Line's verdict, too, is a secular affair, whereas the true matter of the conflict has been spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to discover whether <span class="title">In Hazard</span> meets the second demand of its author as regards vividness and quickeningness we must turn to a consideration of the idea-image. Let's begin by looking at it in its (deceptively) simplest form. The oddest creature on board <span class="title">Archimedes</span> is the lemur Thomas, whose favourite nocturnal pursuit is prising open the closed eyelids of any sleeping sailor bold enough to leave his door ajar. Entering the wheelhouse during the storm. Captain Edwardes finds Thomas at work on the clamped lids of the fear-frozen second mate: "Captain Edwardes cuffed the little lemur away, as you would drive a vulture off a dead body." (p. 91). There are two ideas, two images here, linked by simile: that of cuffing the animal, that of driving off the bird. The sentence is brisk, business-like: "cuffed" suggests a father's summary chastisement of a persistently aggravating child. But is his action really like beating a vulture off a corpse? We are all implicated in the action by that "you" (a favourite Hughes device)—yet how many of us are accustomed to vultures, let alone corpses? But then it's equally pertinent to ask how many of us have cuffed lemurs given to prising open men's eyelids in the night? It's the narrator's tacit, off-handed <i>assumption</i> that his readers commonly do these things that arrest and piques—and, in addition, recalls us to that reality which creative literature at once invokes and transcends. Richard Hughes's interest in the bizarre is an oft-remarked and sometimes denigrated phenomenon, but it's an essential aspect of his art: he deliberately sets out to provoke and delight the intellect through the unexpected image, often one that appeals simultaneously to sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another example. Two paragraphs earlier Mr. Rabb left the Chinese carpenter's room: "He was not really conscious any more. His actions were automatic as a sleepwalker's, with the unswerving tenacity of purpose of pure instinct—like a shark snapping" (p. 90). This extract, I think, might also compel something of a self-confrontation in a reader. In my own case it led to a revaluation. Again there are two similes in the sentence. In the first Rabb's state is likened to that of a sleepwalker. Never having witnessed a sleepwalker, my own notion of what one looks like - a notion as hackneyed as it was intellectually unexamined - used to be that purveyed by childhood story-books and second-rate movies: he (or she) moves rigidly, sluggishly, eyes glazed or altogether shut, sometimes with arms outstretched as if to detect obstructions—a parody of blind-man's buff! Hughes banishes the cliché. "His actions were automatic&hellip; with the unswerving tenacity of purpose of pure instinct": that's surely fine enough for most writers—how forcefully the plosives convey Mr. Rabb's mindless yet decisively direct course through the ship; suggesting indeed a degree of physical self-control, of uprightness. that the conditions could not have admitted. But this isn't enough for Hughes: he must clinch the idea. and he does it with a second image at once vivid and unmistakably Hughesian: "like a shark snapping". What a long way we seem to have come 'in the one sentence, from the simile invoking sleep to this involving the shark's sinister power. They clash head-on, and yet are reconciled in the embracing logic of the sentence. Again Hughes aims to arrest, to surprise, to make his reader think. The aesthetic pleasure to be gained from reading him isn't the kind to be got from merely passive attendance on the beautiful; rather it comes from a complete activity   in which sense and intellect, simultaneously stimulated, conjoin in recognition, synthesis, delight. This I think is very much the order of pleasure that poetry can bring; I shall return to this analogy later.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far in discussing these two instances of idea-images I've been concerned with local effect. But individual verbal events should be related to the recurrent rhythms of the novel, and the examples I've given aren't difficult to place. The lemur-cuffing incident looks both forwards and backwards to other appearances of this animal. That of the sleepwalking Rabb contributes to that interconnected series of idea-images which goes to make up his character-portrait: a penetrating presentation of what blind, uncontrollable fear can do to a man: which is in turn one of a number of comparable rhythms, one of the numerous threads in the novel's human weft that the inhuman warp of the storm ropes closely together. But to follow this rhythm further isn't my task today. Looking again from the particular outwards, however, one might say that the similes of shark and vulture (and, on a larger scale, the appearances of Thomas the lemur), take their rhythmic place in that whole gallery of animal, bird and fish images with which <span class="title">In Hazard</span> (like its predecessor <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>) is infested: the consequence of Hughes's curiously detached naturalist's eye.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having explored some examples of the idea-image, let us pause to register an objection which might be made to the structural emphasis placed by Richard Hughes on this phenomenon. Surely, it will be objected, many writers have recourse to something akin to this method of giving their work internal unity. True, but two qualities distinguish Hughes here from other novelists. First there is the fact of his conscious formulation of the concept, and of his placement of idea-images at the centre of his art. Second there is his quantitative deployment of them. and particularly of sensuous images, which gives his art so much of its originality, strength and appeal. Hughes, lover of the ironic paradox, is a creative writer whose artfulness in shaping his novels is matched by the impression of effortless artlessness a reading of them mainly conveys. Some reviewers comment on the simplicity or naivety of his style, but like the studied simplicity of some other fine writers—I am thinking particularly of poets—its clarity and lucidity deceives about its depth. <span class="title">In Hazard</span> took five years to write. It isn't deciding what to put into a book that takes the time, Hughes was fond of remarking, but what to leave out. What I myself must omit from this survey is discussion of all bar one of what, in my opinion, are the most memorable clusters of idea-images that abound in <span class="title">In Hazard</span>: each reader, if he has liked the book at all, will have one or more permanently stuck in his imagination—one of the descriptions of the seas during the storm, perhaps, or the haunting episode of the birds in one of the lulls, or Ao Ling's surreal dream, or the dance of the dolphins (which one ecstatic reviewer—a poet, unsurprisingly— employing a musical term implicitly sympathetic to my approach, compared to a triple fugue).<a href="#note12"><sup>12</sup></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, by way of illustrating how Hughes sustains individual thematic rhythms I want next to trace the metamorphoses undergone by a linked pair of idea-images in the course of the novel. Ashore at Norfolk Virginia, Dick Watchett, the third mate of the <span class="title">Archimedes</span>, finds himself at a wild party at which the girl Sukie, who has attached herself to him, gets drunk and throws off her clothes: "For a few seconds she stood there, her body stark naked. Dick had never seen anything like it before. Then she fell unconscious on the floor" (p. 17). Dick feels "a wilder intoxication thumping in his ribs. She had been lovely in her clothes. but she was far more lovely like this, fallen in a posture as supple as a pool&hellip;" (ibid.) He rolls her in a hearthrug and returns shaking, to his ship. The next two paragraphs must be given in full:<br/>
            <br/>
            For hours he lay awake, quite unable even to dim the vivid picture in his inward eye of Sukie's drunken innocence. But at last he fell asleep, her lovely face and her naked body flickering in his dreams. And then presently he was awakened by feeling his heavy lids lifted by thin little fingers. and found himself staring, through the texture of his dream, into large anxious. luminous eyes. only an inch from his own: eyes that were not Sukie's. He bashed at the electric-light switch in a panic.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was Thomas, with his soft fur and his big tail, hopping away on his unnaturally elongated feet, nervously folding and unfolding his ears. (p. 18)
        </p>
        <p>
            A few pages later <span class="title">Archimedes</span> is on her way to Colon, putting time and sea between herself and Norfolk, between Dick and Sukie. The girl begins to fade in his mind. But then Dick encounters the dolphins. Again a complete paragraph must be given:<br/>
            <br/>
            At first Sukie had blazed in Dick's mind, lighting every part of it: but now already, after two days, she had contracted and receded like the opening by which you have entered a tunnel: turned more unearthly bright than the broad day, but very distant and small and clear. Yet now, as he watched the dolphins, for a moment light seemed to come back over his whole mind, gently flooding all its dark places, and then fading in a mood of pleasurable sadness. (p. 23)
        </p>
        <p>
            The tone of this is beautifully judged: Dick's sensations and feelings are obliquely conveyed through more images—the first, of the tunnel, precise, visual and familiar; the second imprecise and uncertain (a good example of the weaker intermediate idea-image),   yet luminous, delicate and tender. But why do the dolphins momentarily relume his mind in this way? That same night he encounters another sea-effect: "It was a rare and magnificent thing. But it did not move him as the naked dolphins had done" (p. 24). Now, in the single, telling, wicked word "naked"—a word used twice in those earlier passages about the drunken Sukie—Hughes at once gives us the connection and artfully pricks the romantic bubble of tender sentiment that was Dick's brightened mood. "Naked" is sufficient in itself to reinvoke the whole of Dick's previous experience in a reader's consciousness. From every important point of view—of rhythm, accentuation, sound—it is the focal, energized word in its sentence. A dissyllable following eight unexceptional monosyllables, hard and sharp in its impetus, it cashes in on the abeyance of significant stress that precedes it. If we look more closely we shall see, however, that it isn't the only image-word working to connect Sukie and the dolphins in our minds: when she passed out it was to fall "in posture as supple as a <i>pool</i>"—it was the sensuous liquidity of her abandonment that seized upon Dick's imagination. Later, when he watches the dolphins, these "powerful mermaids" (p. 23) also embody this quality.

            This rhythm of girl-animal association returns a second time, much later in the book. During his long stint of oil-pouring in the forward latrine Dick occupies himself by talking (in his mind) to the absent Sukie:<br/>
            <br/>
            'You see,' he said when he met her again, about a hundred yards further down the cave, 'pouring oil out of this drum is my job.'<br/>
            <br/>
            'Sure,' said Sukie: and leaning forward she stared close into his eyes, laying her beautiful cool eyes almost to touch his briny, swollen lids.<br/>
            <br/>
            'Oh, sure!' she said again: and turning, hopped away on her unnaturally elongated feet, nervously folding and unfolding her ears. (p. 132)
        </p>
        <p>
            We remember that Dick was rudely awakened from his earlier dream of Sukie by Thomas the lemur. Now girl and animal have become one in his mind. Hughes is able, that is, to illustrate Dick's curious mental state, at once vividly active and thoroughly dislocated, merely by repeating (but for a neat change of pronouns) the very same descriptive phrases as before. Here is a case of a "simple" image lightly bearing the weight of a considerable idea.

            One further stage remains to be charted in the series of variations on this rhythm. The two characters whose lives prior to this voyage are, in retrospect, most closely explored, are those of the Englishman Watchett and the Chinaman Ao Ling. Hughes delineates in brief and selective but fascinating biographies the growth and development of religious feeling in children of utterly different races. "Where men's environment, their education, differ fundamentally, flowers from the same hidden root will <i>seem</i> to bear no kinship: will differ 'fundamentally' too" (p. 179). Yet though the visible flowers differ, their roots—the "powerful innate forces in us", "plastic and chameleon-like" though they may be—are common to all men. The general anthropological and psychological observation has been made. It remains for Hughes to press his truth home. We've already seen how that "prime mover" which we call sexuality affected Dick Watchett. In his subconscious mind the naked dolphins and the furred lemur became inextricably entangled with the supple body of Sukie. Towards the novel's end Ao Ling, handcuffed on his prison cot is dreaming: "He was surprised to find a Fukienese girl on the cot beside him. He raised himself on one elbow, to embrace her: but the fine hair on her face and hands warned him that she was but a fox in human shape" (p. 269). Assiduous readers may well discover here a curious anticipation of the next novel Richard Hughes was to write. But that is an aside. How deliciously "Fukienese" chimes with "Sukie"! And can we not be reminded by the fox-girl of the lemur-girl who hopped away from Dick in <i>his</i> day-dream? Thus, Hughes's idea-image invites us to connect the subconscious selves of young men outwardly very different from one another whilst at the same time, through a subtle policy of repetition by variation, he binds together his novel by strong rhythmic threads.

            Let us now turn to idea-images of a different order. When <span class="title">In Hazard</span> first appeared, reviewers varied in their responses to the book's technical or scientific content. V. S. Pritchett commented that Hughes had "revived our lost sense of wonder [before storms] by turning to the scientific though none the less imaginative view".<a href="#note13"><sup>13</sup></a> He found no difficulty in reconciling the author's accounts of "hot air. cold air. pressures and sea-levels" with his telling of a story. John Brophy in a somewhat liverish review, however, encountered "reservations" to his enjoyment: "Mr. Hughes lectures well, about engine-rooms and meterology and so on, but these disquisitions irritate and hold up the story".<a href="#note14"><sup>14</sup></a> Which of these responses should we prefer? Is it possible to accommodate these "lectures" to the notion of idea-images that I have propounded? We can, I think, regard the technical passages as a rhythmic series within the aesthetic whole of the novel. The hurricane as scientifically explicable phenomenon complements the hurricane as aesthetic phenomenon and elemental force. Hughes's storm is nothing if not beautiful, and in its possession of this formal quality it can be said to differ from Conrad's famous typhoon, which, in the sense of this word as it's defined by Kant in his <span class="title">Kritik of Judgment</span> (in a distinction dear to the heart of eighteenth-century aesthetic philosophers), represents a reaching after the sublime.<a href="#note15"><sup>15</sup></a> Certainly Hughes's scientific "disquisitions" possess some of the mannerisms of the lecturer—phrases like "The thing to remember . . .". "And then consider this". Yet if we look closely at a representative passage we shall find that this is only part, and a small part at that, of the picture; we shall not, I think, find such passages lacking in imaginative style or poetic energy—in that kind of beauty we recognize as typical of Richard Hughes's creative art. Here is the circular storm as scientific idea-image:<br/>
            <br/>
            Air moving in from all round towards a central point: and in the middle, air rising: that is the beginning. Then two things happen. The turning of the earth starts the system turning: not fast at first, but in a gentle spiral. And the warm air which has risen, saturated with moisture from the surface of the sea, cools. Cooling, high up there, its moisture spouts out of it in rain. Now, when the water in air condenses, it releases the energy that held it there, just as truly as the explosion of petrol releases energy. Millions of horse-power up there loose. As in a petrol motor, that energy is translated into motion: up rises the boundless balloon still higher, faster spins the vortex. (pp. 34-5)
        </p>
        <p>
            The rhythm of this extract is that of the gradually intensifying motion which it describes. We begin calmly with air moving in and air rising; to which, then, the turning earth imparts a gentle spiral movement. The risen air cools, condenses, and releases its energy—for that energy itself to be translated into motion: and so to the urgent "faster spins the vortex". Within the paragraph at large subordinate idea-images, introduced as clarifying metaphor or simile, add their sensual energies to those of the atmospheric disturbance—the   boundless balloon (a challenging notion!), the explosion of petrol in an engine. And then there are the individual rhythms of sentence and phrase, reinforced by the typical rhetorical resources of the poet. The "technical" parts of <span class="title">In Hazard</span> illustrate, if at times in a modest way, the same aesthetic motives visible in the novel at large.<br/>
            The third quality essential to the successful work of art in Hughes's view was that an artist's conception of rhythm in the various dimensions of his work "must be reinforced by their own interplay". The governing rhythmic conception of <span class="title">In Hazard</span> was, I suggested, the conflict between the <i>Archimedes</i> and her crew and the raw elements. At the risk of simplifying matters we may say that two of the "dimensions" opposed in the story are the forces of the natural world and the products of human technology—perhaps the single most graphic focal point of this antithesis being the ship's funnel, whose guys are designed to withstand a strain of a hundred tons. The last passage I want to glance at reflects fascinatingly on Hughes's desire to create an interplay between these dimensions. At the same time it provides an illuminating comparison with the passage I've just quoted. There we saw what Hughes could produce when he applies (though that is far too crudely mechanistic a verb), without exaggeration. distortion, or any sense of straining after effects, the varied resources of a natural rhetoric to what might otherwise have been a dry piece of explication. The passage, as V. S. Pritchett allowed, was imaginative; yet I wouldn't want to claim that the full <i>transforming</i> powers of creative imagination were involved there. Those powers <i>are</i> decidedly present in the following extract, however: we are in Mr. Mac-Donald's engine-room, giving our full attentions to his ship's propellor-shaft:<br/>
            <br/>
            Think of a tree. The roots of a tree spread in a most complicated manner through the ground, extracting all kinds of necessary things. This nourishment passes, unified, up the plain column of its trunk, and bursts out in the air into a countless multitude of leaves. So all the varying forces, the stresses and resistances, proceeding from that welter of machinery, are unified into the simple rotation of this horizontal column: are conducted calmly along its length into the sea: and there burgeon suddenly into the while and glass-green foliage of the swirls, the tumbling currents, the enormously powerful jostling of crowded water which is a ship's wake. (p. 8)

            In order to attempt to express the order of aesthetic pleasure to be gained from this piece of writing I must return to the claim I made early on in this essay, that Richard Hughes is a poet of the novel. Speaking for myself, the effect of this passage is something like that of an elaborate metaphysical conceit—with two provisions: first that Hughes sustains the conceit to greater length than is normal in seventeenth-century verse, and second that in the vivacious sensuousness of his English he is closer to Marvell than to Donne. Heterogenous things are yoked by violence together—yet the violence has disappeared, absorbed in the effortlessness of the art: we feel no sense of intellectual gymnastics at work to produce an effect—the art is seamless, unselfregarding. unselfconscious. Entities soon to be terrifically opposed on the broad canvas of the novel, the creations on the one hand of inorganic technology ("that welter of machinery") and on the other of organic nature (trees and water), are momentarily not merely compared, are unified, audaciously interfused. It is a paradox that must have given Hughes himself a great deal of pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so to my conclusion. I've not sought to give an interpretation of <span class="title">In Hazard</span>: my task has rather been to examine the practical working of a particular aesthetic theory. Art. the young Richard Hughes believed, should strive to realise beauty. Beauty inhered in "a kind of rhythm", whose elements were "idea-images". Three qualities were said to characterise the successful work of art: first, the individual images must be vivid in themselves; second, they must be organized under a governing rhythmic conception; and third, "the conception of rhythm in all these dimensions must be influenced by their own interplay." I hope that my discussion has done enough to suggest the triumphant presence of this trio of essentials. We should not, then, if my conclusion is justified, be surprised to discover that Richard Hughes himself believed <span class="title">In Hazard</span> to be his most well-constructed and most unified work of art.
