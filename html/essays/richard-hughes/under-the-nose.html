    <h3>Under the Nose and Under the Skin</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Writing in the book section of the <span class="title">New York Herald Tribune</span> in April 1929, the American novelist Sinclair Lewis said that he once received a letter from a woman in the Middle West. She wanted to be a writer, but had nothing to write about. Should she go to New York and "see the world" in order to remedy the deficiency and find a subject? No, replied Lewis: she should capitalize upon her own experience as a mid-Western woman, should stay at home and write about what was under her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
        This advice prompted Richard Hughes, whose first novel <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> had appeared in America the previous year under the title <span class="title">The Innocent Voyage</span>, to contribute an animated article to the same paper. Whilst Lewis's prescription, he said, might seem "simple, practical, unblinking common sense", it was in fact "the merest sentimentality". The material of a novel, he proposed, consists of two parts: what you put in and what you leave out, the latter being the more voluminous. In order to recognize what is under your nose, in order to know what to put into a novel and what to leave out, you need a variety of experience: given that—ideally, at least—the whole world will be under your nose.

        Revisiting this theme two years later in a broadcast talk, Hughes declared:<br/>
        <br/>
        "No, what writers really write about is not so much what is under their noses as what is under their skins, and that they can no more help than a hen can help laying an egg. In that sense all books are autobiographical, even ones which appear to be the opposite. And for a novel to be autobiographical in that sense means not, as is generally supposed, that one of the characters is to be identified with the author, and the others are portraits or caricatures of his friends and enemies, it means that all the characters are the author—or rather, that each is one part of the author, and that they are working out some problem, often in allegory which, whether he knows it or not, is dividing his mind at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
        These words carry us to the heart of Hughes's own novelistic activity. He confesses in the same talk that he himself finds it next to impossible to write about what is under his nose. He set <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> in the West Indies—which he had never visited; took for his central character a little girl—which he had never been; made other important characters pirates—one of the few professions he had never tried; and then had the whole thing happen forty years before he was born!

        <span class="title">High Wind</span>, of course, is no simple adventure-story, although it is vivid and eventful. It is the work of a man born in 1900 who grew through adolescence during the First World War and expected to die fighting it. It is unsentimental, cruel even, ironic, absurd. It is confidently post-Freudian and post-Darwinian. It aims to kill off the lingering romantic view of children as wide-eyed innocents. Hughes is a novelist of ideas as well as a novelist of action, yet a novelist who embodies the first so skilfully in the second that one may pass over them—may, if one chooses, ignore them. In Aldous Huxley's novels the ideas obtrude, tending to dominate and shape the action, to render character and event schematic; in Hughes, as in Conrad, the ideas are implicit, fully-embodied, and require teasing out.

        According to Hughes's definition of the autobiographical novel, its characters are working out some problem that is dividing the writer's mind. The term 'working out' should not be taken to mean 'solving': Hughes said on many occasions that it is the business of creative writers to ask questions—not answer them. 'Working out' is best understood as 'exploring'. The questions probed in <span class="title">High Wind</span> are modern and central: what constitutes 'innocence' and what 'experience'? is human behaviour determined, instinctual, or governable by moral imperatives? are the terms 'good' and 'evil' absolute, relative, or meaningless? when and how does the individual become self-aware and what does it mean to possess a self, to be 'a person'? It is difficult to think of questions more relevant to the modern situation, and it is not surprising that they continued to exercise Hughes's creative intelligence in the further three novels that he was to complete in his lifetime.

        Great writers are 'under the skin' writers. Think of Shakespeare, to go no further (it is, perhaps, impossible to go further). Yet Shakespeare is also the greatest plagiarist of all time: only one of his plays, to our knowledge, has a plot that is original. We excuse his plagiarism because, in the spirit of T S Eliot's audacious dictum, "Immature poets imitate, mature poets steal". Shakespeare stole so blatantly and brilliantly that his order of plagiarism bludgeons criticism into silence. If Shakespeare wrote from under the skin, he also wrote what was under his nose in the sense that he lifted plots, characters, images, ideas, from wherever he found them lying about him—lying about, that is, mostly in other people's books. But what he found under his nose became transformed, through the sympathetic and absorptive powers of his imagination, into what was under his skin. Shakespeare travels in space —he is a European writer, and in time—he is a historical writer. He was a man of the world not by virtue of travelling it in fact, but by virtue of his ability to assimilate and make his own the travels of others.

        Richard Hughes is both a European and a historical novelist. A much-travelled man, he drew in his fiction upon a broad experience of foreign countries and alien cultures as well as upon experience gained through reading. Plainly, and designedly, the two completed volumes of his <span class="title">roman fleuve The Human Predicament</span>  (<span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span>, 1961, and <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span>, 1973) are historical novels and European novels. The action takes place in a variety of locations: Wales, England, Germany, Morocco and America. In choosing to focus upon the history of his own lifetime—centrally the rise (and, had he succeeding in finishing the task, the defeat) of German and Italian fascism—Hughes was, one might think, writing of what was very much under his nose. Yet to write informedly, sympathetically, revealingly over the range he set himself was a considerable task, and could not even be begun until the events themselves were absorbed, digested, inwardly known: known, that is, under the skin.

        Readers and critics of Hughes sometimes remark upon differences between his pre-war and post-war novels. Differences indeed exist, but they do not constitute a unbridgeable gulf. It is not generally appreciated that the two pre-war fictions are historical novels. <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> had its genesis in two accounts of an attack by pirates on the brig Zephyr in 1822, one by Aaron Smith, the Zephyr's mate, whom the pirates abducted, one by an old lady who, then a child, was taken with other children onto the pirate-schooner and royally feasted on crystallized fruit before being returned. What if, thought Hughes, the pirates had sailed away, not with Aaron Smith, but with the children...? As for the tremendous events which befall the steamship <span class="title">Archimedes</span> in <span class="title">In Hazard</span>, they are a precise recreation of what happened to <span class="title">SS Phemius</span> on a voyage from Philadelphia to Colon in November 1932. Hughes was called in by the ship's owners, like "some kind of tribal bard", to record the extraordinary truth. Even details which look like fanciful inventions (such as the ship's inundation by birds when it first enters the eye of the storm) are no less than factual. But the trials of the <span class="title">Phemius</span> struck a profound chord in Hughes's unconscious —so profound indeed that (as he explained in an Introduction* to a later American edition of the novel) he came only retrospectively to understand what he had articulated through the twin symbols of ship and storm. <span class="title">In Hazard</span>, then, resonates with the suggestiveness of allegory: not the formal and elaborate allegory of a medieval mind, but the unconscious allegory of a wholly contemporary sensibility.
