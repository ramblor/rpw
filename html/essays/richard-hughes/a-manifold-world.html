    <h3>A Manifold World: Richard Hughes</h3>
    <br/>

        <h4>1. Onion Man</h4>
        <p>
            The year 2000 is, among other things, the centenary of the birth of Richard Hughes. Hughes died in 1976, and if the quarter of a century that has elapsed since his death hasn't seen the eclipse of his reputation - his novels are all still in print - it's certainly seen no increase in it. For this indifferent state of affairs, Hughes himself is partly to blame. In a life in which he did little else of a professional nature but write (he held a full-time salaried job only during the World War Two), he produced only four novels. The first - <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> (1929) - took three years to write, the last - <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> (1973) - eleven. When confronted by his legendary slowness, he would offer the laconic: "Well, it's a battle between the publisher and the undertaker, isn't it?" Given Hughes's estimate that there would be four, maybe five volumes in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>, his serial novel of his own times, and that by 1973 he'd managed to produce no more than two of them, there was only ever likely to be one winner in this contest. Yet his attitude to writing was shot through with contradiction. He seems both to have been both attracted and repelled by the blank page. As a young man he already felt the need to escape from the tensions generated in the act of writing, and in his later years it was much easier to go sailing. Yet at the same time he knew the inner compulsion of the authentic writer:  "Why do I write novels? Why does a hen lay eggs?"
        </p>
        <p>
            This contradiction at the heart of Hughes's practice as a writer is only one aspect of the complexity of the man. Whilst an undergraduate at Oriel College, Oxford, he was introduced by his friend Robert Graves to Colonel T. E. Lawrence. One night, Lawrence treated Hughes (among others) to a long account of his exploits, and thereafter was firmly ensconced in Hughes's pantheon. In imitation of his hero, Hughes acquired a motorbike, which he called Lord Douglas (Lawrence rode to his death on <i>his</i> machine) and went adventuring in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, a scaled-down version of Lawrence's fiery Arabia. Hughes was fascinated by Lawrence's abjuration of power and embrace of obscurity. Who <i>was</i> this extraordinary man? Hughes likened him to an onion: you could peel off the skins of his personality one by one, but at the centre was nothing. He had no core - just an aggregation of elusively shifting selves.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don’t know where Hughes first came across the onion metaphor - perhaps he happened upon it spontaneously - but he isn't the first writer to employ it. It appears in Ibsen's <span class="title">Peer Gynt</span> (1867), then again in <span class="title">Steppenwolf</span>, Hermann Hesse's famous novel of 1927. There it is part of an inset text entitled "Treatise on the Steppenwolf". The central proposition of this work is that the self or ego, far from being a unity, "is in the highest degree a manifold world, a constellated heaven, a chaos of forms, of states and stages, of inheritances and potentialities… Man is an onion made up of a hundred integuments, a texture made up of many threads".<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> Most people journey through life without ever stopping to consider that their identities and personalities are anything other than stable, dependable entities, as real as the table they eat their dinners off. Yet identity is a precarious thing. That it exists at all is due to memory. Before we develop the capacity to remember, we have no selves, and if we lose that capacity - through the onset, for example, of Alzheimer's disease - we collapse into fragments. Amabel Williams-Ellis - wife of Clough, architect of Portmeirion, and a life-long friend of Hughes - maintained that he was a different person to different people. Among his skins were those of poet, novelist, children's playmate, man-about-town, adventurer, husband, father, civil servant (complete with trilby hat and tightly-furled umbrella), churchwarden, old salt and bearded sage. This range of identities encompasses personae that define the extremes of Hughes's personality: civil servant and churchwarden on the one hand express his need to conform; adventurer on the other expresses his need to rebel. At Charterhouse school during the years of the Great War, the pressure to conform led him to produce scholarship-winning work in his chosen subjects, Greek and Latin, and to the ultimate accolade of Head Boy; yet the cost to him in illness and nervous tension was high. At Oxford he felt freer to kick against the traces. He published an atheistic poem which had a number of dons (including, ironically, Lord Alfred Douglas, ex-lover of Oscar Wilde) up in arms; it earned him a carpeting and a severe reprimand. He neglected his studies, cultivating the company of published poets like Graves, W. B. Yeats and John Masefield, and publishing a stream of reviews, poems and stories in metropolitan magazines. His fourth in classics led to a change of subject to English: then a second fourth of which, with characteristic doubleness, he was both ashamed and proud.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now his adventuring began, an alternative life in which he could escape the cramping confines of respectable middle-classness and flirt with danger. He had missed the ultimate test of the trenches, being a cadet officer at training school when the War ended, and, like others of his age, he felt cut off from those (Graves and Lawrence included) who had lived cheek-by-jowl with death. He travelled steerage to America, throwing in his lot with central European emigrants and getting himself deloused on Ellis Island. He and a group of friends went boating down the Danube and got embroiled in Balkan politics. He made speeches on behalf of Croatian separatists, after which the group found itself forced to flee across the border. He took ship to Morocco with Jim Wyllie, manager of Portmeirion Hotel. There they impudently introduced themselves to the great Glaoui, Lord of the Atlas, and got his permission to explore the interior. Soon enough, however, they were chased out, donkeys, guide and all, by a local lord whose sense of hospitality might require him to provide dinner and a bed, but did not extend to letting aliens live if they were found within his domains twenty-four hours afterwards. The restlessness which these early excursions suggest continued through most of Hughes's life, and while the bulk of <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i> was written in North Wales, he worked at the book on Capodistria and finished it in Connecticut.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps two groups of people are especially given to onion-multiplicity: actors and writers. As actor-manager of the Portmadoc Players, Hughes dabbled in the first of these roles, appearing in his own plays and achieving an early <i>succès d'estime</i> when Nigel Playfair invited the Players to perform at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith.  But it was as a writer that Hughes achieved his most complete liberation from singleness. Keats classified himself, in opposition to "the wordsworthian, or egotistical sublime" as a "camelion poet". Whilst the wordsworthian poet makes the world over into himself, the chameleon makes himself over to the world, entering into and losing himself within bodies and beings which are not his own. Just as it's the nature of an onion to have no core, it's the nature of a chameleon poet to have no nature. Before he could write, Hughes made up poems in his head and dictated them to his mother. But his poems (collected in <i>Confessio Juvenis</i>, 1926), whilst interesting and characteristic, are minor work. He was never able to liberate his full potential within verse. In fiction, however, his poetic powers find their true medium. And by "poetic powers" I mean not simply a capacity for vivid description and evocation. That capacity is real enough and considerable, but beyond it lies the still greater one that enables a writer to create extended metaphors which appeal at the same time to sense and intellect. Hughes's idea-image or <i>eidolon</i> (as he called it) constitutes a "complex", the new word from Freudian psychoanalysis which Ezra Pound lifted in the nineteen-tens to define the multi-levelled or polyphonic nature of the imagist image. Examples are the audacious expression of the otherness and other-wordliness of a small child through an evocation of an octopus in an undersea rock-crevice (<i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i>), and the elucidation of a steamship's turbine and propeller-shaft system through a tree in leaf (<i>In Hazard</i>) - an extraordinary conflation of the mechanical and the vegetable. Such passages lie at the heart of his creative endeavour.
        </p>
        <p>
            There remains one further aspect to Hughes's onion-nature: race or nation. He was born in Caterham to a branch of the Hughes clan long domiciled in England. His first taste of Wales came at the age of eleven, when his mother took him to Barmouth for a holiday. The experience was seminal: back in England he felt homesick for the country he'd just left, and he determined, young as he was, to live in Wales as soon as he was able. The opportunity arose before his schooldays were out. On a visit to Harlech with Charles Graves, younger brother of Robert, he found a cottage to rent and was delighted rather than put off by the spring that rose in one corner, meandered across the floor and left by the front door. This was the first of a series of youthful <i>pieds-à-terre</i>. He moved his mother to Croesor in the 1920s. In the 1930s he and his growing family occupied the castle house in Laugharne, with Dylan Thomas as a neighbour. After World War Two he moved to Môr Edrin, a large house looking across the Dwyryd estuary to Portmeirion. Hughes reckoned to trace his ancestry back to the princes of Powis and kings of Gwent. Without the language, however, he could never be a true <i>Cymro</i>. To describe George Borrow (about whom he wrote a radio play), Hughes coined the phrase "nowhere-at-home", and it is a phrase that might be applied to himself. For all his rejection of England and Englishness, Hughes could act the perfect Englishman when he wanted to, and for all his desire to be a Celt, he seems to have lacked the erratic passions and anarchic ebullience that characterise, for instance, Dylan Thomas. Meanwhile, his contentment with living in Morocco (where he bought his first house) or America (to which he made a number of long visits), imply an ability to accommodate himself to a variety of climates and cultures not his own.

        <h4>2. In search of difference</h4>
        <p>
            Here are three propositions. (1) Richard Hughes is an English novelist. (2) Richard Hughes is a Welsh novelist. (3) Richard Hughes is a European novelist.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems to me that a good case might be made out for each of these identifications. And since Hughes doesn't restrict himself in his fiction to Europe, one might add a fourth proposition: Richard Hughes is a world novelist. This would rest on the Caribbean setting of much of <span class="title">A High Wind</span>, the Chinese element in <span class="title">In Hazard</span> (1938),, the exploration of German National Socialism in <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span> (1962) and <i>The Wooden Shepherdess</i>, and the Moroccan and American chapters in <span class="title">Shepherdess</span>. But to talk about race, nation and place would be to indicate only a part (albeit a large part) of what Hughes is about as a novelist. This, to condense it into a single word, is <i>difference</i>. Richard Hughes is the novelist, <i>par excellence</i>, of difference, of the alien encounter that takes place not on other planets, but on other parts of <i>this planet</i>. If you are a middle-class Englishman, you do not need to travel far to encounter the Other (I capitalise the word, as does Jean-Paul Sartre, one of its foremost theorists). Other accents, other classes and other cultures (one might add, other genders, too!), are all around you. Hughes himself first found another language and another culture in Wales, and he liked what he found. Immediately, he desired a longer immersion. He had discovered that being himself (whatever that self was) required him to open himself to the Other. Hughes has been accused of solipsism, but this is a profound misreading. There are solipsists in his fiction, for solipsism is one possible response to the challenge posed by the Other - to deny its existence. No: almost the whole of Hughes's endeavour is a criticism, sometimes ironic, sometimes grave, of the refusal to admit that the Other exists, is as real as Self is, and has as much right to existence and its satisfactions as Self has. What Hughes, however, was never inclined to do was to minimise the perceived threat offered by the Other.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hell is other people", wrote Sartre, and so it proves for many of Hughes's fictional creations. "Hell", however, can take inanimate as well as animate form. "Hell" offers danger, the chance of self-diminution, even the possibility of extinction. At the same time, the encounter with otherness is also a potential source of self-enlargement, of moral and intellectual growth. Hughes would, I imagine, have been happy to concede the truth of the contemporary maxim No gain without pain".
        </p>
        <p>
            The metaphor that resonates through Hughes's novels is that of the storm. The idea was absent from the American title of his first novel, <span class="title">The Innocent Voyage</span>, but is present in its English title: <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>. Yet the hurricane that destroys the Jamaican home of the Bas-Thornton family and provokes father and mother to send their children to the presumed haven of England is only a harbinger of what is to come. Human nature proves more destructive than weather, or nature's nature: the hurricane is only a warning which, translated, signifies: Security is an illusion, danger is everywhere. The true alien encounter is between pirates and children, adults and "innocents", a mock-Darwinian struggle in which the newer species proves more adaptable and better fitted for survival than the older one. By a brilliant twist of the fiction-maker's mirror, Hughes illuminates the child as Other. His Emily is a direct retort to Rousseau's unspoilt child of nature and Dickens's sentimentalised little Em'ly. When she believes her life to be endangered, Emily kills to defend it: and as the novel ends, with her beloved but ineffectual captain strung up on the gallows as a result of her testimony, she melts into a crowd of English schoolchildren, unidentifiable in the ruck. But if an "innocent" child can kill a grown man, what are the parameters of identity and morality? <i>Who</i> are we, <i>what</i> are we?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> had the Great War in its blood, if not in its literal text. It is a novel of catastrophe, albeit a catastrophe of an ironic kind. So was its successor, <span class="title">In Hazard</span>, which anticipates the atmosphere and, uncannily, even some of the particulars of World War Two. Here it's the storm which engulfs the steamship Archimedes that constitutes the Other: it is man versus nature on the grand scale. With its funnel torn out by winds of previously unrecorded savagery and utterly helpless, Archimedes is carried by massive seas over reefs which in normal conditions would have torn her bottom out. In these extreme conditions - the trenches of the sea - the seamen find out what they are made of. Some buckle under the test, others come through it. All survive the storm: the book's single death occurs in its aftermath when the chief engineer falls asleep from exhaustion and goes overboard. It's a characteristic Hughesian irony. Inset into the greater conflict is a lesser encounter between Europeans and Chinese. Dick Watchett vanquishes the young communist Ao Ling, but it is a failure of sorts and counterpoints Dick's success in fighting the storm: there can, it seems, be no understanding between these children of different cultures. For his part, Ao Ling is shown to be still fighting old battles - son against father, an oedipal conflict nurtured in the womb, and unwinnable.
        </p>
        <p>
            For his serial novel <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>, Hughes took for his subject the rise of German National Socialism, a historical force that would erupt into the storm of the second World War. Catastrophe again, and again on the grand scale. He never got to the war itself, however. <span class="title">Fox</span> and <span class="title">Shepherdess</span> climax in a matching pair of lesser storms, the first in the Munich <i>putsch</i> of November 1923 (Hitler's failed rising against the Bavarian political establishment), the second in the Night of the Long Knives of 1934 (Hitler's ruthless purge of the <i>Sturm Abteilung</i>). For a British reader, the dominant Other in the novel is Nazism, a seemingly relentless historical force which will sweep all before it. At the level of individual fictional lives, however, there are a variety of alien encounters. Here the chief figure is Augustine Penry-Herbert, a scion of the Anglo-Welsh squirearchy. Hughes makes Augustine his own age and gives him many of his own experiences. Augustine functions as a kind of experimental antenna thrust out into cultures and histories he cannot understand. In <span class="title">Fox</span> he spends time with his Bavarian cousins, comically misunderstanding the economic and political realities of their lives and fondly imagining that blind Mitzi von Kessen is in love with him. In <span class="title">Shepherdess</span> he acts out Hughes's own adventures in the Atlas mountains, but his most significant experience is with a group of liberated, sex-game-playing teenagers - a culture radically different from that of his own country and class. From the latter encounter he once again retreats, baffled. Mitzi, meanwhile, has become a nun and is deep inside her own, more spiritual explorations. Her encounter is perhaps the ultimate one that Hughes conceived, for here the Other is God. In the figures of Hitler the dictator and Mitzi the nun we reach the ultimate terms in Hughes's Keatsian dialectic of wordsworthian/chameleon natures. Hitler, the solipsist, is one for whom others do not exist: his ego absorbs everything, transforming human contraries into the Wagnerian opera of his fantasy-life. Mitzi, conversely, submits herself to the divine Other, and feels her ego shrivel to nothing beneath His incandescent gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
            The undertaker overtook Richard Hughes after he had drafted just twelve chapters - sixty pages - of the third volume of his <i>magnum opus</i>. No incomplete work of fiction is more frustrating than this one. Looking back from the vantage-point of his centenary, however, we can see that Hughes's life and writing form a remarkably unified whole: the principle of contradiction lies at the heart of both the man and his fiction. His writing gives expression to that "manifold world", that "constellated heaven" which for Hermann Hesse characterised modern, multi-skinned man. In order to enter that world, we need only open one of Hughes's books and start reading.
