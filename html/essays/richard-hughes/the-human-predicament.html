            On May 21, 1969, Richard Hughes delivered the annual Blashfield Address to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> Entitled 'Fiction as Truth' this succinct twenty-minute talk was concerned with the crucial importance of the writing and reading of novels in and for the lives of human beings. Its basic assumption, however, was that the reading of novels isn't nowadays regarded as an integral element in the daily lives of educated people; the novel is losing ground to other kinds of books (one might add, to other forms of entertainment). Hughes regarded this as a disastrous trend. That his central thesis was expressed in a typically Hughesian ironic inversion doesn't, I think, undermine its importance either for him or for us: "the present general retreat of readers from Fiction into a cloud-cuckoo-land of actualities and abstract studies is at the very least a flight from reality, bespeaks an escapist frivolous generation. Possibly, a doomed one." For Richard Hughes it isn't the writing or reading of fiction (as one so often and so irritably hears) that's escapist; rather it's the belief of representative, apparently intelligent men that the pursuit of fiction is escapist, is beneath their attentions, that is so. Such a man's refusal to countenance fiction carried disturbing psychological implications for Hughes, who believed him to be making "a solipsist retreat into the fortress of his own 'I am' - a retreat similar to an autistic child's. "For there is one unpalatable fact which Fiction might <i>make</i> him apprehend: the fact that other people are not 'things' but 'persons'."
        </p>
        <p>
            The kind of experience we need in order to realize that others are 'persons' like ourselves cannot, Hughes asserted, be had in real life. "Socially, we live more and more like cells in a single great organism: semantically, cybernetically, invent more and more means of intellectual conference: but in our consciousness we remain incommunicable islands." Even in marriage man and wife are separate, reduced to tapping out loving messages on the dividing wall. It's only through the writing and reading of fiction (or watching plays or films, to the extent that these are forms of fiction) that we can become aware that the world contains persons other than ourselves : "then we do repeatedly adopt someone else's 'I am' for our own. Briefly paroled from our solitary cells, we think what he thinks as he thinks it; we <i>are</i> him feeling—whatever he feels; for the moment, we're no longer ourselves." 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes's assertion that people remain essentially the prisoners of their consciousnesses in actual life is very close to an expression of belief by another celebrated novelist over forty years earlier: 
        </p>
        <p>
            In daily life we never understand each other, neither complete clairvoyance nor complete confessional exists. We know each other approximately, by external signs, and these serve well enough as a basis for society and even for intimacy. But people in a novel can be understood completely by a reader, if the novelist wishes: their inner as well as their outer life can be exposed. And this is why they often seem more definite than characters in history, or even our own friends <a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            E. M. Forster derives a compensation from the knowability of people in novels for their dimness in life. Forster and Hughes, whose novels in some respects will bear comparison. <a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> have their roots in the same tradition of English liberal humanism. An objection arises at this point to Hughes's argument, however, that is allowed for in Forster's discussion of the people in novels. Forster discriminates between Homo Sapiens and Homo Fictus: they have much in common, are allied species, and yet are different. Hughes's assertion that we can experience human beings as 'persons' only in novels contains the implicit assumption that, despite the contrast as regards knowability, a man in a work of fiction and a man in actual life are alike in their humanity, and that, when reading novels, we allow them to be so. Is this, even when one takes into account the propagandist and apostrophic nature of The Blashfield Address, too large an assumption to let pass in the present day? The novel of characters, the novel which numbers amongst its distinguished practitioners Dickens, Balzac, George Eliot, Flaubert, Tolstoy and James, is in our time very much under attack. On the one hand one encounters the argument that the novelist who, appearing not to recognize that his creation is an artefact, does not actively make his reader aware that he is dealing with a work of words and not real life, is in danger of falling into solipsism and regarding himself as God. I've argued elsewhere that in his first novel <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> Hughes does in fact exploit the tension between a reader's willingness to accept the characters before him as 'real' and the novelist's ability to remind him that they are, after all, fictional, inventions of the writer.<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the two published volumes of <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>, however, Richard Hughes takes up a more conventionally omniscient stance and, despite the confidently twentieth-century aspects of his work (the Freudian analysis, for instance), it's hard to see how many modernists could fail to dismiss it as anachronistic both in its form and in its conception of character.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand the novel of characters is damned on a host of interrelated grounds—economic, political, sociological. Can there be said to be a future for the individual, either actual or fictive, in a world situation where, since the end of the Second World War, and in spite of the defeat of fascism most advanced societies, whether liberal-democratic or communist, have seen the individual increasingly subject to collective controls, whether by a bureaucratic state apparatus, by the pressures of the industrial urban environment, or by the conditioning apparatus of a capitalist high-consumption society"?<a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus the French novelist and critic Alain Robbe-Grillet can confidently claim: "The novel that contains characters belongs well and truly to the past. It was peculiar to an age—that of the apogee of the individual."<a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> If there is a future for novels (which seems doubtful if you agree with M. Robbe-Grillet, since the rise of the novel of characters seems to have accompanied the historical growth of economic individualism) it seems doubtful whether there can be one for 'persons' in novels. If human societies are increasingly to be collective in nature, then the hero of a novel fit to reflect life in such a society ought logically to be a collective being rather than an individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Viewed from the perspective provided by such a case, the refusal of representative, apparently intelligent, men to have anything to do with fiction can be interpreted as a symptom of such a process of collectivization. If people cease to see themselves as individuals and begin to see themselves as collective beings, why should they waste their time reading books which represent them as having an individuality they can neither comprehend nor appreciate? Was Hughes then casting himself in the role of apologist for a way of thinking and feeling already doomed, a rearguard with his back to the wall?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us at this point recall that <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is an <i>historical</i> novel, a novel that, completed, would have spanned the period from 1919 to 1945. It occupies a fascinatingly ironic and paradoxical position. A work that portrays character in the liberal humanist literary tradition, it sets out to explore the very period in which the literary values it implicitly embodies came most severely under attack. It seeks to depict the very age which has made the creation of authentic 'persons' by novelists so fraught with difficulty. Its major historical character is Adolf Hitler, central figure in the development of German national socialism—one of the most powerful movements for human collectivization in this century. It is no coincidence that in The Blashfield Address Hughes asserted that "The Archetypal non-reader of Fiction was Hitler." Elsewhere he recognized that there are traitors in the very camp to which he belongs: "Today, even the novelists themselves seem to have lost faith in themselves." <a href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a> He did not do so himself. <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is his own major contribution to the embattled position of liberal humanism, and to keeping alive the novel of characters. Not only does he portray in it the age which has seen such severe blows dealt to the ethic to which he was committed, but one of the individuals most responsible for the character of that age. One of his great achievements is to recreate Hitler, the totalitarian, as a person.

        <p>
            The prefatory Note to the first volume of <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> includes the following statements:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is conceived as a long historical novel of my own times culminating in the Second World War. The fictitious characters in the foreground are wholly fictitious. The historical characters and events are as accurately historical as I can make them: I may have made mistakes but in no case have I deliberately falsified the record once I could worry it out. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This suggests a sharp distinction between the two kinds of characters we shall encounter in this book: some will owe their inclusion to the existence of actual lives lived in the recent past, others to the creative powers of the imagination alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            This division looks intractable, but let us question it: if its separate parts sit comfortably enough together in the term 'historical novel', why not <i>within</i> such a work? Are what is 'fictive' and what 'historical' truly so mutually exclusive? Is it not in fact the case that an interpenetration of some sort occurs when the actual and the imaginary meet in a work of this kind—interpenetration meaning more than a mere rubbing of shoulders by representatives of opposing factions? Two perspectives are possible here, resulting in complementary propositions. First: are not, in an important sense, <i>all</i> the characters in an historical novel 'historical'? Clearly a writer may choose to defer to 'the record' in his portrayal of persons who actually have lived; but mustn't he also defer to history when depicting persons he has invented? It's essential that such characters be 'true to history'—they must be supplied with sensibilities appropriate to a particular era, awarenesses whose contemporaneousness is that of a period of time past, not of the present in which their creator writes. He may not regard them with the creative eye of the artist alone, he must also view them through the corrective spectacles of the historian. This is a proposition I want to uphold in this essay. Second: aren't the historical characters in a novel touched by the fictional process? Can it he that every word written about them will be found verbatim in 'authorities'? Agreed, the response may come, but why let the argument rest here? Doesn't the novelist, as soon as he begins to speculate about his historical characters' unacknowledged motives, to investigate their neuroses, to depict the complex workings of their minds in dream, step across a divide which separates the biographer and historian from the novelist? The argument has turned sour, for it has led on to the re-establishment of the very distinction whose denial was being sought. This difficulty can, I think, be dealt with in this way. Many historical novels <i>do</i> demonstrate the existence of the divide I have mentioned—those, for example, of Scott. I want, however, to deny its existence in the case of Hitler in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>; although it's true to say that Hitler is, for a brief period, 'fictionalized' by Hughes, the verb is misunderstood if defined in its modern reductive sense of 'fabricated', 'falsified'. It will lie an essential part of my continuing argument to maintain that in this portrayal of Hitler from within, the historical novelist's imagination neither fabricates nor falsifies; that, seen from a wholly tenable viewpoint, what is depicted here is no less than the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is my intention in this essay, then, to explore the imaginative methods and techniques which enable first an interpenetration of the fictive and the historical in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>, and further their identification in the portrayal of Adolf Hitler. An examination of Richard Hughes's Hitler constitutes the last and longest part of this essay. Before that, however, I want to discuss two areas, where fiction and history interpenetrate: the scenic description, which Hughes charges with significance at once psychological and historical, and the depiction of fictive persons at a vibrant period in historical time.

        <h4>3.</h4>
        <p>
            In the first and last chapters of <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span> (1961) fiction and history interpenetrate in the scenic description, the novelist's set piece, his equivalent to the musician's cadenza. I choose the word 'scenic' rather than 'natural' or 'landscape' advisedly since in one of the passages I want to discuss both these latter are present, and because Augustine Penry-Herbert, the 'hero' of <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>, himself takes care to distinguish between Nature and landscape. He's musing on the scenery of Havana at the time:<br/>
            <br/>
            Since landscape changes like this from country to country it must owe very little to Nature: Nature is no more than the canvas, and landscape the self-portrait the people who live there paint on it. But no, hold hard! Surely, rather the people who <i>have</i> lived there for landscape is always at least one generation behind in its portrayal .  (<span class="title">Fox</span> p 349)<a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite his self-correction, Augustine is both right <i>and</i> wrong. In the first passage I want to examine, from the opening chapter of the novel, landscape and Nature are both present, and Augustine's second thoughts don't allow for what this particular landscape can reveal about Augustine himself. The second extract comes from the last chapter of the book, and here, though we're confronted with Nature in the raw, we see that she's entirely capable of conveying a truth about the historical situation in which contemporary Germany is placed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Augustine himself is a presence in both these passages, it's a very different presence. In the first he's observed, one of two unidentified men who pass before our eyes; in the second he's observer—what's seen comes to us by way of his consciousness. In the latter instance the scene is charged with significance <i>in situ</i>, our apprehension of its symbolic nature is immediate, in the former the scene acquires significance mainly in retrospect as, gradually, we discover more and more about Augustine. The two examples embody approaches Hughes continually plays off against each other—the one viewing a character from within, presenting his thoughts as he thinks them, the other viewing him from without, objectively. Hughes utilises this twofold method both for his fictive and his historical characters, as we shall see in the course of this essay. It's intimately related to his ironic method, at one moment lulling the reader into an unthinking identification with a character, at the next compelling him to withdraw and view that person critically, from the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the opening chapter of <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span> two men, the younger carrying over his shoulder a dead child, emerge from a drenched and silent sea-marsh. The technique is reminiscent of Hardy. They reach "a lofty but tangled and neglected wood".
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon however the two men turned off by a short-cut, a steep footpath squeezed between a ferny rock the size of a cottage and a watery plantation of twenty-foot bamboos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the bamboos their path tunnelled under a seemingly endless ancient growth of rhododendrons and they had to duck, for though the huge congested limbs of this dark thicket had once been propped on crutches to give the path full headroom many of these were now rotten and had collapsed. At the very centre of this grove the tunnel passed by a small stone temple, but here too the brute force of vegetation was at work, for the clearing had closed in, the weather-pocked marble faun lay face down in the tangle of ivy which had fallen with him, the little shrine itself now wore its cupola awry. Thus it was not till the two men had travelled the whole length of this dark and dripping tunnel and finally reached the further border of all this abandoned woodland that they really came right out again at last under the open whitish sky. (pp. 14-15)
        </p>
        <p>
            This is in itself evocative: the damaged faun resonates with the dead child, each a victim of the neutral but relentless forces of nature. A few chapters of acquaintance with the younger of the men, however, flesh the detail richly and intriguingly. The image of the tunnel occurs in Chapter 4 where it's connected with Augustine's realisation that an unbridgeable gulf separates his own from every previous generation:
        </p>
        <p>
            The kind of time called 'History' ended at the Battle of Waterloo: after that, Time had gone into a long dark tunnel or chrysalis called the Victorian Age. It had come out into daylight again at the Present Day, but as something quite different:  it was as impossible to imagine oneself born a Victorian or born in 'History' as&hellip; as born a puma. (p. 23)
        </p>
        <p>
            Augustine and Time take comparable journeys. It's only after he has passed out of the sea-marsh and through the dark wet vegetable tunnel with the dead child's body (it shapes itself into a matrix of his shoulder, alien yet intimate) that he's able to emerge into the light of common day, to emerge into a state of consciousness. Marsh and tunnel are unobtrusive symbols, but their provenance is unmistakable: we're spectators at a rebirth into life. Later we come to understand that Augustine has existed since the end of the war (it's now late 1923) in what amounts to a condition of suspended animation. His adolescence, passed in the war years, had been a preparation for an inevitable early death ("they knew they were unlikely to live much beyond the age of nineteen"— p. 109); granted by the end of hostilities a sudden and unexpected lease of life, he has simply not known what to do with it, has vegetated in the family mansion at Newton Llanthony. It takes the intimate experience of a death to stimulate him into life, now at last he comes forth from the dripping 'womb' of the vegetable tunnel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ruined temple with its fallen and ivy-entangled faun is an enigmatic ingredient in the tunnel. Augustine and his old University friend Jeremy Dibden agree that theirs is "a generation relieved of the necessity even of active evangelical atheism because the whole 'God' idea [has] now subsided below the level of belief or disbelief" (p 73). It's tempting to see the faun, in the light of the passage about Time, as symbolic of a self outgrown and left behind amongst the outmoded, decaying religious forms of the Victorian era, an era which no longer allows sufficient headroom, an era from which Augustine believes himself to have won his intellectual emancipation. He is a convinced disciple of Freud. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This early landscape then, takes on meanings in retrospect which derive from the psychological and historical concerns of the novelist. It's <i>Augustine's</i> landscape: an intimate mirror into which, unknowingly, he has looked, it bears his reflection long alter his physical self has gone elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes explores the political condition of post-war Germany in Books Two and Three of <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span>. In the final chapter of the novel the implications of this exploration are, by way of Augustine's own disordered consciousness, given expression in a single embracing symbol, a symbol at once mysterious and terrifying. Out walking from Schloss Lorienburg, unable to decide what action he should take regarding tlie blind girl Mitzi with whom he's desperately in love, he comes upon the partially frozen Danube:<br/>
            <br/>
            The road to the station took Augustine close to the river itself. Even now the river was not everywhere frozen: here and there where the current was strongest there were still patches of dark grey water that steamed in the sun, so that the solitary swan indefatigably swimming there was hall-hidden in vapour. But elsewhere the Danube seemed to be frozen solid in heaps. It was wild, yet utterly still. Huge blocks of ice had jostled each other and climbed on top of each other like elephants rutting and then got frozen in towering lumps or had swirled over and over before coagulating till they were curled like a Chinese sea. None of them had remained in the place where first it had frozen: each block was complete in itself but now out of place—like a jig-saw puzzle glued in a heap helter-skelter so that now it could never be solved. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was all such a muddle! Although it was utterly still it expressed such terrific force it was frightening: the force that had made it—thrusting floes weighing hundreds of tons high into the air, and the force it would release when it thawed. When that ice melted at last it would go thundering down the river grinding to bits everything in its path. No bridge could possibly stand up to it. The longer you looked at its stillness, the greater your feeling of panic&hellip; Augustine <i>hated</i> Germany: all he wanted now was to get away as quick as he could. (p. 351)
        </p>
        <p>
            This description of bewildered and bewildering piles of ice, animal in their size and nature, conveys with muscular immediacy the vast potential power imprisoned in post-war Germany itself, suggesting a country balked and frustrated, a people politically and spiritually disorganised. Beneath the perverse and petrified shapes of ice the current of tradition continues to flow, but is visible only intermittently, is in the main submerged. The lone swan, emblem of grace and purity (and for Shelley and Yeats of the free untrammelled soul), seems in danger of being swallowed up in the vapour the sun makes rise from the water and the ice. The problems symbolically embodied in this tremendous confusion of ice are unsolvable, but nothing is more certain than the eventual, and random, release of its pent-up force. No bridge will be able to withstand it. Bridges are emblems of communication, of connection. "The longer you looked at its stillness, the greater your feeling of panic&hellip;  Augustine <i>hated</i> Germany." The sudden appearance of the second person pronoun compels the reader to share his fear and hate. Augustine's realisation of his feelings about Germany is intuitive, unarticulated, a reader's may be conscious or unconscious, but at this point it's hard for him not to sympathise with Augustine. The contained but brutal power that inspires the young man's fear and hatred will, released, inspire fear and hatred in Europe and beyond, wreck Europe, and send ripples into most corners of the inhabited world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The frozen river provides <span class="title">Fox</span> with an impressive climactic closure. It also provides a fine example of how the fictive and the historical interfuse in Hughes's creative method. What Augustine apprehends in the Danube is at once personal, a psychological truth, something made possible by a spontaneous upheaval in his sensibility, and general, a symbolic encapsulation of the condition of a culture - an historical truth. Although he doesn't realise it, Augustine has briefly made contact with the raw essence of history—a force of its nature immaterial, whose inherence in these chaotic banks of ice is merely momentary. His flight from it couldn't have been more headlong had he comprehended his experience.<a href="#note9"><sup>9</sup></a>

        <h4>4.</h4>
        <p>
            Augustine believes that the kind of Time called 'History' ended at the Battle of Waterloo, its place being taken by a formidable but static entity known as the Victorian Age. He doesn't believe that his own life belongs to History, and whatever happens in the world during his lifetime he will not regard as historical. This, for the 'hero' of a historical novel, is a nicely ironic state of affairs. But, as his experience at the end of <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span> implies, his belief that he exists apart from anything as mundane as 'an historical process' is false, it can only be maintained in <span class="title">Fox</span> because he remains imperturbably insular, seemingly neither able nor willing to appreciate what's going on around him, and only, when the pulse of history beats so loudly in his ears as to compel his reluctant attention, capable of responding to it by flight. In <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> (1973) he is drawn into, or commits himself to, the historical process on a number of occasions—the Prohibition-breaking rum-running schooner, the cause of the Welsh miners in 1926, the Moroccan adventure—but despite these sallies there are no signs that he consciously revises his ideas about history. Eventually, at the beginning of Book Three of <span class="title">Shepherdess</span>, his friend Ludo, including him in a grand generalisation, confronts him with a striking home truth: "You're capable only of seeing the world through your own English eyes, so all you see is a mirror reflecting your own English faces and can't conceive that what makes Germans tick is other than what makes you tick yourselves." (p. 200) Augustine's reply is a submissive query: "We're hopelessly Anglomorphic?" Ludo's succinct truth might well stand as the moral of Books Two and Three of <span class="title">Fox</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Augustine's easy assumption of superiority to politicians and politics is very much a product of his Oxford 'education'. "At Oxford (that intense white incandescence of young minds) everyone had been agreed that only inferior people feel an itch for power, or even consent to have it thrust upon them&hellip; To Augustine, even honest statesmen and politicians seemed at best a kind of low-grade communal servant—like sewer-cleaners, doing a beastly job decent men are thankful not to have to do themselves." (<span class="title">Fox</span>, pp. 69-70) The hyperbole is instinct with irony. His distaste for politics, however, is soon revealed as the mere tip of the iceberg of his ignorance of contemporary European affairs: his reactions on first encountering rampant Weimar inflation illustrate a total incomprehension of the harsh realities of life in Germany in 1923. His response to the "incredible noughts" on the banknotes he receives in exchange for a ten-shilling note is to think "What a joke'"; his realisation that he's just become a billionaire makes "his head swim a little" (p 132). His inability to grasp the political situation in Bavaria is, however, turned to positive account by Hughes. Augustine's ignorance constitutes at once an ironic vehicle by means of which the gulf separating English and German sensibilities is revealed and explored, and Hughes's trump card in persuading the reader to appreciate what Augustine can't, in enabling him to experience politics and political history as dynamic living things.<br/>
            How does this come about? Augustine, to state the obvious, is a fictive character in an historical novel. But his refusal to recognize that he lives <i>within</i> history, contained in the historical process, makes him an outsider to it even though he exists in its presence. Now the reader too is an outsider, an external observer of the world of the novel that's at once historical and fictional. If he's British (and not a professional historian) he's likely to possess little or no knowledge of Bavarian history in the nineteen-tens and twenties. Aware, on the other hand, of Augustine's extensive blind-spots, of his self-regarding insularity, he will not seek with impunity to identify himself with this young Englishman, since to do so is to leave himself unprotected before the continual jet of irony directed by the novelist at his hero. To escape this irony, on the other hand, he needs merely to open his awareness to the Bavarian situation, to the speculations and memories, the enthusiasms and apprehensions of Augustine's proud Teutonic hosts: to lend himself to a creative history-lesson both informative and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the dinner-table of his aristocratic relation, Baron Walther von Kessen, a staunch Bavarian monarchist, Augustine is comically but instructively out of his depth. He's vaguely aware that 'Germany' is a fairly new idea (in fact a mere forty-eight years old), and that Bavaria until quite recently was a sovereign country, but these are facts that possess no vital significance for him. Unable to comprehend that what's at stake at this critical moment of time is nothing less than Bavaria's political future, its ideological identity, he's oblivious to the animated conversation of the male von Kessens. Interpreting their jokes and allusions from a hopelessly English point of view, he perpetrates one <i>faux pas</i> after another —saved only, as it happens, by the fact that his cousins find him as incomprehensible as he finds them. At one point in the conversation Walther is prompted by his own inquiries about the British Labour Party to relate his part in the events of five years before: then, a Centre Party deputy to the Bavarian parliament, he had been in Munich when the revolution of 1918 broke out that led to the abdication of the Wittelsbach king. It's clear that the Bavarian socialists' method of bringing democracy to his fatherland was little to Walther's liking: <br/>
            <br/>
            "How little even <i>we</i> knew then of the unscrupulous Socialist mentality!" said Walther pointedly. "You are aware what happened, of course?"<br/>
            <br/>
            "What?" asked Augustine, half polite, half curious. To Augustine, who elected to ignore public events any-way, the events of 1918 already seemed centuries ago lost in the mists of time; but even now Walther could hardly pronounce <i>Eisner's</i> name in a normal voice—the rabble-rousing animal Eisner, from Berlin, with his straggling beard and floppy black hat like a seedy professor of piano-forte&hellip; marching into the city that night with lorry-loads of all the hooligans of Munich at his heels! It was red revolution, of course&hellip;<br/>
            <br/>
            "They tore off my uniform in the Odeonsplatz," said Walther. "I was lucky to get home safely in borrowed mufti, I can tell you! And the dear old King chased from his bed: Bavaria is to be a republic, forsooth, after a thousand years of Wittelshach rule! And Ei… that Kurt Ei… Ei… <i>Eisner</i>, with a gang of Galician Jews like himself for his cabinet—lunatics, lamp-lighters, gaol-birds, Judases&hellip;"<br/>
            <br/>
            Having reached this surprising (but in fact literally truthful) peroration Walther had to pause for the moment for breath and for his blood to cool&hellip; (<span class="title">Fox</span>, pp.144-45)
        </p>
        <p>
            Energetic and partisan, Walther doesn't merely <i>recall</i> the past —he <i>relives</i> it with a passion that makes it immediate and dramatic. He brings the socialist leader Eisner to vivid life in twenty words, a deliberate caricature of a human being and yet a grotesque whose historical importance for Walther is testified by the vitriol he pours over him. The contrast between the apolitical and anti-historical Augustine and his exuberant host could hardly be more marked: Walther is essentially a political animal, a creature whose habits of mind are utterly alien to his guest. Walther's re-living of his own past not only vitalises history, expressing the dramatic quality of the past as past, but demonstrates its capacity for a rich and dynamic awakened life in the present. Here, in the spacious dining room of this ancient baronial castle, it is Augustine's convictions and habitual ways of feeling that are irrelevant, out of key. It's therefore appropriate that he should repeatedly be spitted on the barbs of his own misunderstandings. It's he, with his dogmatic and narrow view of 'History', who is refusing to live in the present, to recognize that present for what it truly is—history in action.
        </p>
        <p>
            He doesn't, however, remain entirely impervious to the implications of his conversation with the obsessively political von Kessen menfolk. As he lies in bed afterwards and the wine he's drunk begins to recede, his mind flickers into rapid life. First its "chaotic involuntary plungings" begin to take shape as a poem; then the distant sound of a piano brings Cousin Walther, the probable pianist, to the forefront of his thoughts:
        </p>
        <p>
            Augustine began to wonder about people like Walther. Were they actually the way they <i>talked</i>—unreal creatures, truly belonging to that queer fictive state of collective being they seemed to think was 'Life' but which he thought of as 'History'? Or were they what they looked —real people, at bottom, just as human and separate as Englishmen are? Was Walther the freak he seemed? Were all the others here—indeed, all Germans—like him? (pp. 154-55)
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically he comes to no conclusion here; nevertheless for a time he questions his own dogmas, re-examining his habitual dismissal of people like Walther as collective beings, as less than human. That Augustine should equate the collective with the unreal is revealing. Walther could hardly he further removed from the sort of character one might imagine one would find in a totalitarian novel; yet Augustine is tempted to dismiss him as a one-dimensional being. Augustine in fact furnishes for us and for his creator a prime example of the person who can't conceive of other human beings as persons: he would be well advised to consume his share of novels! Blindly applying a parochial conception of what a  'real' human being should be to those he meets, he fails to recognize that people differ according to country, class, creed, education. To have Augustine equate the collective with the <i>fictive</i> must have pleaded the sharp sense of irony of the author of the Blashfield Address: Augustine is himself a fictive being—and yet, clearly not a collective being. It's a fine state of affairs when a fictional person who denies the contemporaneousness of 'History' contemplates dismissing fellow-characters who <i>do</i> recognize the reality of the historical process by committing themselves to it with all their energies as "unreal"—pathetic souls deluded by a collective neurosis into supposing their preoccupation with the world of actions and events to bequeath them reality!
        </p>
        <p>
            To his own way of thinking, Augustine represents twentieth-century man, a creature emancipated from the characteristic follies of his ancestors by the discoveries of the great liberating thinkers of the nineteenth century. He would have done well to keep at the forefront of his mind his friend Jeremy's assertion that his [Augustine's] cynosure Freud was a <i>Victorian</i> (<span class="title">Fox</span>, p. 72). That he's by no means so unVictorian as he believes himself to be is shown by the very poem he's just been composing in his head: he has enough critical sense to perceive its shortcomings, and these are telling indeed:<br/>
            <br/>
            <i>Oft have I stood as at a river's brim 
            In girls' clear minds to watch the fishes swim: 
            Rise bubbling to their eyes, or dive into places 
            Deep, yet visible still through crystal faces&hellip;</i><br/>
            <br/>
            He was rather pleased with the beginning, at first—its detached attitude was so adult. But then he grew disgruntled with its idiom. Why didn't his few poems, when they came, arrive spontaneously in modern idiom - the idiom of Eliot, or the Sitwells? They never did&hellip; 'Oft&hellip; ' <i>This</i> idiom was positively Victorian. <i>Victorian</i> idiom&hellip; ? (p. 154)
        </p>
        <p>
            These thoughts might well give him pause. As we have seen, it's an article of belief to him that the Victorian Age is dead; he finds it as impossible to imagine himself born a Victorian as born a puma. His poem's idiom, an expression of sensibility, demonstrates ironically that his emancipation from the previous century is not as complete as he would wish.<a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a>

            Augustine and Walther are conceived as antitheses, the one reluctant to recognise the existence of the historical flux, the other finding his <i>raison d'être</i> within it. Different as they are, each is psychologically and historically authentic, true to the disparate elements reconciled in tlie term 'historical novel'. The delineation of actual historical persons in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> also demands a reconciliation. Here, it may be thought, the existence of 'the record' ought to be a positive aid to the novelist who seeks to understand such a person, and to depict him as knowable. Yet it is equally arguable that the record must positively restrict the novelist, for it places bounds on his creative imagination, limiting the scope of a force that, the Romantic artist claimed, delights in limitlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes contents himself with working extremely close to the record where historical persons and events are concerned. Each and every appearance made by Hitler, the subject of the remainder of this essay, is vouchsafed by documentary sources. And I don't merely mean his <i>physical</i> behaviour in each appearance : what he <i>says</i> is also warranted by the record. Even in the one chapter where, at length, we are made privy to what he <i>thinks</i>, his thoughts to a very large extent constitute an imaginative reconstruction of experiences described by his biographers. If the remainder of this essay shows, as I hope it will, with what skill Richard Hughes fashions Hitler's life anew as art, it will also show how literally faithful to "the record" he remains in doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes's method of portraying Hitler differs from situation to situation. He is introduced obliquely as "some egregious pocket-demagogue of Roehm's who (it appeared) also tagged in somehow with the Kampfbund" (<span class="title">Fox</span>, p. 179). His emergence as a personage to be reckoned with is as gradual (allowing for the compression of actual into fictive 'time' that occurs in a novel) as it was in history. Before he appears in person in the book his personality and doings are described and discussed at some length by various interested parties—notably the self-appointed "Hitler-watcher" Dr. Reinhold. We come face to face with him at last during the Munich <i>putsch</i>, planning with Ludendorff and Göring the ill-fated march on the Odeonsplatz. This acquaintance is brief: not until we next meet him in retreat at Uffing (at the home of his friend and comrade Putzi HanfstaengI) shall we be admitted to the intimate workings of his mind. Thereafter we are cut off from the inner man: in <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> he is unvaryingly viewed from the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            I shall examine three separate passages in which Hitler is portrayed. The first two are alike in approaching him from outside, but offer a mutual contrast. The Hitler of the first is eccentric but explicable, the Hitler of the second enigmatic and unknowable. The third context combines two different but complementary approaches, one illuminating Hitler through direct portrayal of his consciousness, the other offering a psychological explanation of his personality. Hughes's depiction may both attract us and repel us, but it never does less than fascinate.

            Augustine himself is present on one of the occasions when Hitler forms a topic of conversation. His outlandish behaviour in society—at the Hanfstaengls', Helene Bechstein's, the Bruckmanns'—provides the substance for a lively anecdote:
        </p>
        <p>
            "The formula is much the same everywhere these days", said a rather squat actor-type, rising and moving down centre: "First: a portentous message that he'll be a bit late—detained on most important business. Then, about midnight—when he's quite sure that his entrance will be the last—lie marches in, bows so low to his hostess that his sock-suspenders show and presents her with a wilting bouquet of red roses. Then he refuses the proffered chair, turns his back on her and stations himself at the buffet. If anybody speaks to him he fills his mouth with cream puffs and grunts. If they dare to speak a second time he only fills his mouth with cream puffs. It isn't just that in the company of his betters he can't converse himself—he <i>aims</i> to be a kind of social upas, to kill conversation anywhere within reach of his shadow. Soon the whole room is silent. That's what he's waiting for: he stuffs the last cream puff half-eaten into his pocket and begins to orate. Usually it's against the Jews: sometimes it's the Bolshevik Menace: sometimes it's the November Criminals—no matter, it's always the same kind of speech, quiet and winning and reasonable at first but before long in a voice that makes the spoons dance on the plates. He goes on for half an hour—an hour, maybe: then he breaks off suddenly, smacks his sticky lips on his hostess's hand again, and &hellip; and out into the night, what's left of it." (<span class="title">Fox</span>, p. 199)
        </p>
        <p>
            A reader unfamiliar with the Hitler of biographers and historians would have to be forgiven for assuming this passage to be an elaborate invention of the novelist. It is in fact a version of a description of Hitler given by a fellow guest at a party in 1923, and it was quoted by Konrad Heiden in his <span class="title">Hitler, a Biography</span> (London, 1936). Richard Hughes said he had never read this book: yet he <i>did</i> read Alan Bullock's <span class="title">Hitler, a Study in Tyranny</span> in which the passage concerned is quoted in full:<a href="#note11"><sup>11</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hitler had sent word to his hostess that he had to attend an important meeting and would not arrive until late: I think it was about eleven o'clock. He came, none the less, in a very decent blue suit and with an extravagantly large bouquet of roses, which he presented to his hostess as he kissed her hand. While he was being introduced, he wore the expression of a public prosecutor at an execution. I remember being struck by his voice when he thanked the lady of the house for tea or cakes, of which, incidentally, he ate an amazing quantity. It was a remarkably emotional voice, and yet it made no impression of conviviality or intimacy but rather of harshness. However, he said hardly anything but sat there in silence for about an hour; apparently he was tired. Not until the hostess was so incautious as to let fall a remark about the Jews, whom she defended in a jesting tone, did he begin to speak and then he spoke without ceasing. After a while he thrust back his chair and stood up, still speaking, or rather yelling, in such a powerful penetrating voice as I have never heard from anyone else. In the next room a child woke up and began to cry. After he had for more than half an hour delivered a quite witty but very one-sided oration on the Jews, he suddenly broke off, went up to his hostess, begged to be excused and kissed her hand as he took his leave. The rest of the company, who apparently had not pleased him, were only vouchsafed a curt bow from the doorway, (pp. 102-103)
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes's fidelity to 'the record' is remarkable: this, however, is hardly surprising, for the original<a href="#note12"><sup>12</sup></a> is vivid enough despite being cast in a rather literary style and tone. The novel preserves, one after another, the significant details of its source: the message, the late arrival, the bouquet of roses, the cakes, the long initial silence, the anti-Semitic oration together with its length, and Hitler's kissing of his hostess before he takes his leave. The only alteration of fact concerns the proffered chair, which in the original is accepted. The only significant omissions are the crying of the child and the description of Hitler's expression while being introduced—this last an omission for which I'm unable to account, since it adds to the eccentricity of his behaviour. The significant additions are almost all visual, aimed at increasing the vividness of the description: so, Hitler's sock-suspenders show when he bows, his roses are "wilting", the cakes become particularized as "cream-puffs" (the last of which he stuffs into his pocket prior to launching into words)<a href="#note13"><sup>13</sup></a>, his voice makes "the spoons dance on the plates", and the kiss lavished on his hostess's hand is delivered by adolescently "sticky lips". None of these does violence to the original account or weakness the historicity of the actor-type's description.
        </p>
        <p>
            Heiden's account must have cried out to be appropriated, for it is rich with memorable visual images that any novelist would be proud to have invented. What it needed, however, is equally obvious— 'translation' into colloquial English, into the manner of speaking of a specific person. (In length it isn't significantly shorter—a mere forty words in a passage of two hundred and eighty.) Richard Hughes gives the description to a "squat actor-type" who knows just how to deliver it in order to make the most of it. For him it can justifiably take the form of a <i>speech</i>, becoming direct, dramatic, rich with gesture and emphasis (consider, for instance, the wealth of conjunctions, which positively point the listener's (the reader's) attention to a new fact or action, a development in the situation). No one, as Dr. Reinhold is made to remark afterwards (the comment is originally Heiden's), who encounters Hitler at a party is likely to forget him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hitler is in both passages an eccentric. In Heiden's account his eccentricity carries an ominous force, possesses sinister overtones. The novel transforms this tone, tlie actor-type bringing a humorous quality into his narrative that serves to disarm behaviour that might otherwise give serious cause for alarm, colours it as the antics of a social misfit. To this end there are a number of significant adjustments in style and tone: the blunt description of Hitler yelling in a powerful penetrating voice is transformed into metaphor, the comic hyperbole of spoons dancing on plates: the detail of the child being wakened is omitted (this too particular a detail in what tlie actor-type presents as typical behaviour); the violent single-mindedness of Hitler's verbal onslaught on the Jews is softened by being buffered by droll references to the cream puffs and the sticky lips they create; and the measured sternness of his leave-taking in the original is given a throwaway abruptness in "and out into the night, what's left of it."
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, however, there are indications in the actor-type's speech that there is more to this buffoonery than might appear to the cursory eye. A final difference between the two versions is that whilst the novelist provides clues to the solution of the riddle of Hitler's behaviour within the anecdote itself, the biographer provides a separate commentary after the story. The actor-type goes no little way towards making sense of his eccentric: he states that Hitler actually <i>aims</i> to poison conversation, so that when the room is silent he can take over the whole party. Behind the posturing lies a formula for self-advertisement, a strategy for self-advancement. Konrad Heiden spells out at length what in the-novel must be inferred:
        </p>
        <p>
            He was a social climber who had no desire to be agreeable but had the courage to attract attention. For this purpose there were three golden rules, which he was not the first to discover: make a point of arriving late, then you are noticed; take no part in the conversation, thereby making yourself at most agreeable but not otherwise attracting notice; then, suddenly, start gabbing like a maniac, so that everyone is reduced to silence, for thereby you force people to pay attention to you; then go away before the company breaks up, so that those who are left behind can talk about you, which deepens the impression. (pp. 104-05)
        </p>
        <p>
            The characterization of Hitler as a "social climber" is a sobering underestimation; nevertheless Heiden's analysis reveals the tactical calculation behind the apparently crazy conduct. The weird becomes the comprehensible. It isn't surprising that the account should give the thoughtful Dr. Reinhold pause; it might well give the reader pause too.
        </p>
        <p>
            What in Heiden was history becomes in Richard Hughes fiction; yet the historical authenticity of the original account is preserved in every essential particular in the novel. Hughes's portrayal of Hitler at the party is both amusing and instructive: what seems from one point of view to be the madcap antic of a social misfit from another reveals itself as the tactic of a brilliant demagogue: it's a miniature lesson in socio-political strategy.

            At the party Hitler himself provides the focus of interest; his behaviour there is calculatedly public, and the motives that prompt it are fathomable. Elsewhere the approach to him is oblique; the man we see broodingly private, his thoughts impenetrable. We glimpse a darkly mysterious Hitler in the following passage. The location is the Hotel Dreesen at Bad Gödesberg, time the afternoon of June 30, 1934. The night to fall will become known in history as The Night of the Long Knives, for Hitler will then rid himself of all troublesome elements in his Party at one fell swoop. A minor character, Ernst Krebelmann, a recent recruit to Himmler's S. S., has together with his friend Hans been posted sentry on the Hotel terrace. Below them is the Rhine, beyond it a range of "vine-clad mountainous hills—the Siebengebirge, capped by thunder-clouds white in the sun". Hans, taking a peep as he passes the windows of the dining-room, catches sight of the party leaders within:
        </p>
        <p>
            Forgetting discretion, the two young men turned their heads till they nearly twisted them off their shoulders. But then they had to stop their patrolling entirely to goggle, for windows alas are made to look out of not into—the plate-glass reflected the brilliant blue sky, tlie mountains, the thunder-clouds, even their own silly faces but barely revealed those dark living figures inside, as faint and as insubstantial as ghosts. Yet the Führer was certainly there, striding the length of the room and biting the nail of his little finger. At Hitler's elbow was Göbbels, and&hellip; Was that or wasn't it Göring, away at the back there with all those others? (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span>, p. 349.) 
        </p>
        <p>
            The two young men are joined by a third:<br/>
            <br/>
            All at once (and as if they'd been tantalised quite enough), a cloud passed over tlie sun and those brilliant reflections suddenly dimmed and faded, the shadowy figure behind the glass turned solid and clear. Yes, there indeed was Dr. Göbbels: his lambent eyes never left the Führer—they'd almost the look of a ferret's eyes watching which way the rabbit would bolt&hellip; His lips were moving, he seemed to he urging something; but not a word could be heard through the thick plate-glass—not even a sound.<br/>
            <br/>
            "It's like at an old silent movie," said Hans. <br/>
            <br/>
            "Yes," said the new arrival: "Only there aren't any subtitles telling us what's going on."
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile it grew even darker. A flash, and a rumble of thunder—and then came the rain. It fell like a cloud-burst. The three young men turned their backs to the glass, and flattened themselves against it for shelter as best they could. The thunder crashed, forked lightning weirdly lit the Wagnerian scene as the rain-lashed tree-tops bent to a sudden wind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cold water was slowly trickling down his back inside his clothes when something made Ernst turn his head; and there—behind his shoulder, and only an inch or two from his own—on the other side of the pane was the Führer's face looking out.
            The gaze of a man half-conscious: vague, shifty, glassy, settling nowhere and seeing nothing, (pp. 350-51) 
        </p>
        <p>
            The sudden darkness, the thunder, the rain, and above all the weird forked lightning might be thought a legitimate invention of a novelist bent upon charging a crucial scene with 'atmosphere' to the highest possible degree. Again, however, Hughes is enormously indebted to the record. Ernst's experience is based upon that of an actual historical figure, Walter Schellenberg, who by 1945 had risen to be the youngest of Himmler's S.S. generals, and an early advocate of peace negotiations. Schellenberg joined the S.S. in 1933, and on June 30 of the following year found himself sent to guard the fashionable Hotel Dreesen: 
        </p>
        <p>
            All day strange and disquieting rumours had reached my unit. There were said to be plots, divisions in the Party, and impending disasters. It was whispered that the highest leaders of the Party were coming to the hotel and I was posted outside the French windows that led from the terrace to the dining-room, from which point I could look down over the valley of the Rhine to the mountains beyond. Inside the dining-room preparations had been made for a conference, and before long 'they' arrived: it seemed the rumours were true. In the dining-room were assembled the highest leaders of tlie Nazi movement, among them I recognized Hitler, Goebbels and Goering. I could see their changes of expressions and the movement of their lips, though I could not hear what they said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, black clouds had been gathering over tlie valley and now the storm broke. As the rain poured down, I pressed myself back into the shelter of the building. Lightning forked across the sky, illuminating the scene with a weird and frightening glow. From time to time Hitler would come to the window and stand staring at the tempest with unseeing eyes. He was clearly labouring under the burden of weighty and difficult decisions <a href="#note14"><sup>14</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again Hughes happened upon a passage perfectly suited to his purposes. Again he's remarkably faithful to his source, his task again being to convert the received elements into novelistic terms. This, as before, is achieved with resounding success.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major refinement concerns viewpoint. Since Schellenberg is intent upon relating matters of great historical interest, his account concentrates attention on the crucial room and its occupants. In the chapter of <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> which deals with the same events, it's the minor characters in the novel's foreground who enjoy the bulk of the novelist's attention: yet they don't, in the final analysis, <i>dominate</i> matters. Only for two brief moments is the Fiihrer brought into clear, dramatic focus. Hughes's references to him run parallel to Schellenberg's. In the first of these the description of Hitler's nail-biting is clearly indebted to the fact that Schellenberg initially could see only the expressions and <i>lips</i> of the Nazi leaders. In the second Hughes concentrates into a single moment an action that in the original takes place "From time to time". I shall return to this particular event in a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            A second refinement concerns the young men's attempts to see through the window. Schellenberg makes no mention of any difficulties involved in seeing into the room. At first, however, the young guards in the novel find this problematical. As long as it stays sunny and bright the figures within remain "as insubstantial as ghosts". Only with the arrival of dark clouds do they become "solid and clear''. The novel presents us with an intriguing and suggestive paradox: whilst the outside world is bathed in light the Nazi leaders remain shadowy; when it darkens they assume definition. Darkness—the colour of coming night—is their true and unnatural element. Most fully illuminated is the predatory Göbbels. who rates a concise but intense description again developed out of Schellenberg's unembroidered statement that he could see only the lips and expressions of those within.<a href="#note15"><sup>15</sup></a> Göbbels at this moment in time was in a tricky position, for, carefully observing from a certain distance thc power-struggle within the Party, he'd long kept his loyalties uncompromised, joining the major planners of the bloodbath, Himmler and Göring, only when the situation became critical and a choice had to be made. That the Führer alone could offer him adequate protection against personal liquidation is explanation enough of his intense interest in the decisions still to be made.<a href="#note16"><sup>16</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The passage quoted, and the chapter, end with this climactic fourteen-word evocation of a numinous, preoccupied Hitler : "The gaze of a man half-conscious: vague, shifty, glassy, settling nowhere and seeing nothing." It's a sentence that goes on reverberating in the mind after it has been read. In the first hardback edition, the blank whiteness of almost a whole page confronts the reader's eyes immediately after he reads of the "nothing" that Hitler sees, so that he sees what Hitler sees. It's also a sentence that induces almost a physical sense of suspension in the mind. Its indefiniteness of statement is as much a matter of syntax as of sense: consisting of a trio of adjectives and an adjectival phrase in apposition to a noun phrase, and therefore wanting a governing verb, it seems to float free in the text, its indeterminacy providing a complete contrast to the concrete factuality of the previous paragraph. Its syntactic structure enacts its rootlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            I stated above that in this final description of Hitler, Hughes concentrates into a single occurrence an action that Schellenberg says took place several times. There is a further difference between the two versions: whilst Schellenberg <i>explains</i> the Führer's introspection Hughes does not, choosing instead to expand the suggestive "with unseeing eyes" of the original. As a result we're confronted by a very different Hitler from that of the party scene. This is no half-comic, half-sinister eccentric, a man acting out a <i>persona</i> he has devised for himself: with Ernst we glimpse a man looking not out upon the world but looking within, locked in a contemplation of his own thoughts and feelings, a being mysterous and unknowable—as unknowable as a 'person' in real life. What Hitler's thoughts and feelings might be like, we shall see in the next section.

            In the passages depicting Hitler discussed so far, Hughes portrays his subject very much from the outside. At the party and at the Hotel Dreesen the reader is in the position of an observer: even though he can, in the first of these, find a logical explanation for Hitler's behaviour, he remains unaware of his private thoughts. Elsewhere Hughes seeks to balance his external approach by penetrating into the inner man and revealing the operation of Hitler's unique mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prominent in this exploration is his interest in the morbid psychology of his subject, and in Hitler's sexual identity. Hughes portrays him as a solipsist, his ego that of an infant which has survived into adulthood, so that in him a young child's antisocial amorality exists alongside a mature adult intelligence.<a href="#note17"><sup>17</sup></a> Hitler's own 'I' is the only reality of which he is aware: he cannot grasp the separateness of other human beings; to him they are things rather than persons, tools to be manipulated in the obsessive furtherance of his own grand designs. He's incapable then of normal sexual relations, since sexual love involves each partner in the recognition of a separateness—the 'otherness' of the other.

            The chapter from which the following extract is taken is a <i>tour de force</i>, providing the only occasion in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> in which Hughes permits himself the liberty of imagining the intimate workings of Hitler's consciousness. This portrayal is carefully prepared and set in context. After the failure of the <i>putsch</i> of 1923 Hitler escapes to the home of his friend and comrade Putzi Hanfstaengl at Uffing. There, exhausted and in considerable pain from a dislocated shoulder, he lies sleepless in the attic of the house:
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly the bells started ringing: the Sunday bells of Uffing, beating on his ears with their frightful jarring tintinnabulation. Whereon somebody must have started pulling a clapper in Hitler's own head too, for his own head started chiming with the bells of Uffing. His head was rocking with the weight of its own terrible tolling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flinging back the blanket Hitler gazed desperately round. His trusty whip stood just out of reach, but how he longed to hear again instead of those clanging bells the whirr of its clean singing thong of rhinoceros-hide—the whining and the <i>crack</i>! If he had given those three traitors a taste of it instead of letting them through his fingers he'd have been in Berlin by now—yes in BERLIN!
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>'Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and robbery &hellip; the noise of a whip &hellip;'</i> (To think that this very hour he should have been riding triumphant through Berlin!) '&hellip; <i>the noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots &hellip;'</i> (In Berlin, scourging the money-lenders from the temple! A city in flames!) <i>'There is a multitude of the slain, and a great number of carcases; there is none end of their corpses, they stumble upon their corpses &hellip;'</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Scourging the hollow barons &hellip; scourging the puking communists &hellip; scourging the Lesbians and the nancy-boys with that rhinoceros-thong!
        </p>
        <p>
            But that barrel—it was changing shape: now tall now short, now fat now lean &hellip; erect, and swelling &hellip; and out of the swelling barrel a remembered figure was rising—smooth and gross, and swaying and nodding like a tree. It was a man's figure from his own penurious teen-age in Vienna: it was that smooth-faced beast at the Hotel Kummer, bribing the bright-eyed hard-up boy with cream puffs, promising him all the pastries he could eat and daring to make passes at <i>him</i>, at Adolfus Hitler!
        </p>
        <p>
            Then under the hammering of the hells the figure collapsed—suddenly as it had risen.
            Scourging the whores, the Jews &hellip; scourging the little flash jew-girls till they screamed &hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
            Now the dark corners of the room were filling with soft naked legs: those young Viennese harlots sitting half-naked in the lighted windows all along the Spittelberggasse (between the dark windows where 'it' was already being done.) For once upon a time the young Hitler used to go there, to the Spittelberggasse: to &hellip; just to look at them. To harden his will; for except by such tests as these how can a lad with the hair new on him be assured that his will is strong? The boy would stare, and walk on a few yards; then come back as 'strong' as ever—back to the most attractive and most nearly naked and stare her out again, pop-eyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            He called it "the Flame of Life", that holy flame of sex in the centre of a man; and he knew that all his whole life <i>his</i> 'Flame' had to be kept burning without fuel for at his first real touch of human, female fuel it must turn smoky, fill his whole Vessel with soot. This was Destiny's revealed dictate: if ever Hitler did 'it' the unique Power would go out of him, like Samson and his hair. No, at most if the adult male flesh itched intolerably it might be deviously relieved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alter all, how could that monistic 'I' of Hitler's ever without forfeit succumb to the entire act of sex, the whole essence of which is recognition of one 'Other'? Without damage I mean to his fixed conviction that he was the universe's unique sentient centre, the sole authentic incarnate Will it contained or had ever contained? (<span class="title">Fox</span>, pp. 264-266)
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a lengthy quotation, but its abbreviation would be undesirable even if it were possible. It is a fine example of Hughes's complex and heterogeneous creative method. It is still more than that, however: here he attempts and pulls off his most ambitious imaginative <i>coup</i>—he <i>becomes</i> Adolf Hitler.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, you may say, Hitler is no 'ordinary' fictional character, he was an actual historical person: how can a novelist do other than <i>pretend</i> to know such a character? I wish to maintain, nevertheless, that Richard Hughes does <i>become</i> Adolf Hitler: that here Fiction presents us, neither more nor less, with Truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was in The Blashfield Address that Hughes expressed his belief that only in the writing and reading of fiction can a human being grasp the fact that others are 'persons'. The novelist is able to induce this ability in his readers because "It is [his] unique ability to station himself inside someone else's innermost 'l am' and look out on the world through eyes other than his own. Not to peer in, but to see out &hellip;" This unique ability is demonstrated in the attic at Uffing: there Hughes doesn't speculate objectively' on what goes on in Hitler's mind, he <i>thinks himself into his</i> character, achieves a vantage-point from which he can look out upon the world from within.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me again state the obvious: <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is an historical novel. In such a hybrid work the fictive and historical imaginations exist in so intimate an interrelationship that they are, to say the least, extremely difficult to distinguish. The philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood, in comparing the products of novelist and historian, concludes that "As works of imagination [they] do not differ" except in so far as "the historian's picture is meant to be true".<a href="#note18"><sup>18</sup></a> In practical terms 'truth' for the latter signifies deference to three rules of method from which, Collingwood avers, the novelist is free: the localisation of his picture in space and time, the observance of self-consistency, and "relation to something called evidence". <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> observes the first two of these demands throughout and the third when treating material appropriate to the historian, as I hope my earlier analyses have suggested. Collingwood's notion of history cannot be distinguished from the 'fictionalised' history of Richard Hughes's novel. Collingwood discriminates between what he calls the 'inside' and 'outside' of events: by the latter he means "everything belonging to it which can be described in terms of bodies and their movements"; by the former "that in it which can only be described in terms of <i>thought</i>" (my italics). The historian's work may, for him, "begin by discovering the outside of an event, but it can never end there; he must always remember that the event was an action, and that his main task is <i>to think himself into this action, to discern the thought of its agent</i>" (Ibid. p.213; again my italics). What Collingwood's belief amounts to is that the historian must attempt to <i>become </i>the historical person lie wishes to understand, to become him Just as Richard Hughes seeks to become Hitler in the passage before us.
        </p>
        <p>
            How then does the historian come to know the thought of the human object of his investigation? Precisely, says Collingwood, through the historical imagination. This, using Kantian language, he names <i>a priori</i>, signifying that "it is in no way arbitrary or merely fanciful" (p. 240). He further denies the "prejudice" which holds that what is imagery must be fictitious or unreal: "The imaginary, simply as such, is neither unreal nor real" (p. 241). 'The historian's task, then, can never consist merely in assembling a patchwork picture of his subject from his sources and authorities ("scissors and paste history"). These are not "evidence", since evidence for Collingwood is also subject to verification and approval by the historical imagination. "Everything is evidence which the historian can use as evidence… The whole perceptible world… is potentially and in principle evidence to the historian'' (pp. 246-47). The historian's end must be the creation of "a web of imaginative construction" verified and justified alone by his own critical intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            What Richard Hughes gives us of Hitler in the attic at Uffing is "a web of imaginative construction". Since his concern now is with the <i>inside</i> of an event (Hitler's retreat to Uffing after the failure of the <i>putsch</i>), is to re-create thought, everything is evidence which can be used as evidence. About the task of rethinking Hitler's thought there is nothing arbitrary or fanciful: the imagination governing this act is <i>a priori</i>, at once critical and creative. What we are given is neither more nor less than tlie truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us now go back to the passage quoted. It begins with third-person narrative and ends with omniscient authorial analysis. The characteristic currency of paragraphs two to five, however, is that ambiguous descriptive prose often found in novels which enables the writer to present the thoughts and images which pass through a character's consciousness at once as if he, the novelist, were recounting them and the character experiencing them: the distinction between creator and created is collapsed. Thus in "If he had given those three traitors a taste of it instead of letting them through his fingers he'd have been in Berlin by now—yes, in BERLIN!" the idea appears to issue simultaneously from novelist and character. In the third paragraph the participle "scourging" escapes from its qualifying auxiliaries and takes on a relentless life in the present: for Hitler himself, in his delirium, what's being imagined assumes the immediacy of reality, of action ensuing in the present. Even the italicised passages seem to emanate at once from novelist and character.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key to the unity of the early paragraphs is the whip. Hitler's disturbed thoughts are on revenge, and the whip is the weapon with which he imagines himself carrying it out. This whip of course existed, a gift to Hitler early in his political career from Elisabeth Buchner, the landlady of his favourite guest-house in Berchtesgaden. It provided Hughes with a ready-made symbol, expressive at once of Hitler's cruelty, lust for dominance, and repressed sexuality. Hanfstaengl describes Elisabeth as "a towering Brunnhilde type with a flashing gold tooth" and goes on sardonically to comment that Adolf "had developed for her one of his unproductive, declamatory passions. He used to play the romantic revolutionary for her benefit, stamping round and cracking his rhinoceros-hide whip".<a href="#note19"><sup>19</sup></a> The intimate relationship between the racial, sexual and political in Hitler's consciousness is brought out through the scourging, which is to fall indiscriminately upon the barons, communists and false triumvirate (Lossow, Kahr and Seisser); lesbians, homosexuals and whores; and the Jews. Hitler identifies himself, as chastiser of his enemies in Berlin, with Christ in the temple at Jerusalem. Blasphemous or not, this is again no more than an echo of fact; not only was it an idea ever-present in Hitler's mind, he himself connected it with the whip. Dietrich Eckart, the editor of the <span class="title">Volkischer Beobachter</span>, once confided to Hanfstaengl whilst sharing a room with him at the Buchners', that something has gone completely wrong with Adolf. The man is developing an incurable case of <i>folie de grandeur</i>. Last week he was striding up and down in the courtyard here with that damned whip of his and shouting, 'I must enter Berlin like Christ in the Temple of Jerusalem and scourge out the moneylenders', and more nonsense of that sort. I tell you, if he lets this Messiah complex run away with him he will ruin us all.<a href="#note20"><sup>20</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            What Eckart reports objectively as a statement made by Hitler is transformed in the novel into a subjective psychological truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's again the whip that provides the cue for the passages in italics. Here Richard Hughes takes his largest imaginative liberty with Hitler, and yet if one is inclined to dismiss the possibility of the Führer reliving a passage from the Bible it's worth noting that he had "learnt a lot" from it; atheist though he was by the time Hanfstaengl came to know him, "he still paid lip-service to religious beliefs and certainly acknowledged them as the basis for the thinking of others." <a href="#note21"><sup>21</sup></a> The <i>a priori</i> imagination seeking to know the thought of Hitler finds that, in his ravings, he identifies himself with the First as well as the Second hypostasis: for the voice of Nahum here is also that of Jehovah, threatening the downfall of Nineveh in the seventh century before Christ (see <span class="title">Nahum</span> 3:1-3 in the Authorized Version). <a href="#note22"><sup>22</sup></a> The inclusion of part of Nahum's triumphal ode allows Hughes also to perpetrate a terrible irony: a "great patriot" and a "passionate" nationalist, Nahum was "the last of the great classical Hebrew poets":<a href="#note23"><sup>23</sup></a> Nahum's own race, over two millennia later, is to be a major victim of Hitler's great 'purge'.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Führer's hallucinations resurrect memories from his youth. Young Adolf's daring of the Spittelberggasse and his encounter with the homosexual at the Hotel Kummer are both described by his boyhood friend August Kubizek in the only extant biography of this period of his life. Here is Kubizek's account of the meeting with the homosexual:<br/>
            <br/>
            One evening, at the corner of Mariahilferstrasse, a well-dressed prosperous looking man spoke to us and asked us about ourselves. When we told him that we were students ... he invited us to supper at the Hotel Kummer. He allowed us to order anything we pleased and for once Adolf could eat as many tarts and pastries as he could manage. Meanwhile, he told us that he was a manufacturer from Vocklabruck and did not like anything to do with women, as they were only gold diggers. I was especially interested in what he said about the Chamber music which appealed to him. We thanked him, he came out of the restaurant with us, and we went home.<br/>
            <br/>
            There Adolf asked me if I liked the man. "Very much," I replied "A very cultured man, with pronounced artistic leanings."<br/>
            <br/>
            "And what else?" continued Adolf with an enigmatic expression on his face.<br/>
            <br/>
            "What else should there be?" I asked, surprised. <br/>
            <br/>
            "As apparently you don't understand, Gustl, what it's all about, look at this little card!" <br/>
            <br/>
            "Which card?"<br/>
            <br/>
            For, in fact, this man had slipped Adolf a card without my noticing it, on which he had scribbled an invitation to visit him at the Hotel Kummer.<br/>
            <br/>
            "He's a homosexual," explained Adolf in a matter-of-fact manner.<br/>
            <br/>
            I was startled. I had never even heard the word, much less had I any conception of what it actually meant. So Adolf explained this phenomenon to me. Naturally, this, too, had long been one of his problems and, as an abnormal practice, he wished to see it fought against relentlessly, and he himself scrupulously avoided all personal contact with such men. The visiting card of the famous manufacturer from Vöcklabruck disappeared into our stove. <a href="#note24"><sup>24</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the novel this incident undergoes a radical transformation, demonstrating clearly the difference in kind between the imaginative engagement here and that productive of the passages discussed in previous sections of this essay. In Kubizek's account Hitler is self-possessed and unperturbed; he appears to take the encounter in his stride; he's the embodiment of sexual <i>sang-froid</i>. The hallucinatory re-entry of the homosexual into his consciousness at Uffing could hardly offer a greater contrast: the figure is lurid, epicene, so charged as to suggest a tempter both repellent and attractive: "gross" and bestial, the figure is also "smooth", "smooth-faced". Did Hughes find Kubizek's statement that homosexuality had been one of Hitler's "problems" satisfyingly ambiguous? With the compression of the event in the novel comes an alteration in its nature and significance. What in the original is lacking entirely in the sensational becomes in the novel a fully dramatised psychological happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a while it looks as though Hughes is going to treat the Spittelberggasse incident in a similar way. With the second sentence of the new paragraph, however, comes a sudden, though not abrupt, withdrawal, and we again find ourselves outside Hitler. We've glimpsed for a brief moment the inner man, and it's time to take stock: the rest of the quoted extract consists of omniscient authorial analysis of his peculiar psyche—a fair gambit for the psycho-analytical historian. In discussing "the Flame of Life" Hughes again draws on Kubizek, who admits that he often had to struggle in order to grasp the meaning of his young friend's "bombastic formulae" but defines this entity as "the symbol of sacred love which is awakened between man and woman who have kept themselves pure in body and soul and are worthy of a union which would produce healthy children for the nation." (p. 172) Hitler's obsessive chastity reveals itself as a foundation-stone for Hughes's broad understanding of him as a solipsist. With the final sentence of the extract we experience the novelist at his most omniscient—his own 'I am', indeed, makes a brief curtain-call. Illustration and analysis, what has been shown and what stated, now dovetail, and we see again, but from a different angle, how Hitler can, to himself, seem God Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stephen Spender has written that "Mr Hughes 'creates' the characters of Hitler and some of his colleagues as though they were fictitious in the way that his unhistoric characters are".<a href="#note25"><sup>25</sup></a> Here the inverted commas and the qualificatory "as though" keep open the right options. The inner Hitler in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is a product of the <i>a priori</i> imagination, a force at once creative and historical: <i>historical</i> because Hughes has, in Collingwood's words, thought himself into an historical action, discerned the thought of its agent; <i>creative</i> because the 'record', a constituent of that which can he used as 'evidence', is reshaped in psychological terms as memory, hallucination, desire.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems unlikely that Collingwood's view of what it is to be an historian would find ready acceptance by many academic historians who, holding a different conception (or different conceptions) of 'science', would balk at ascribing so fundamental a part in the reconstruction of the past to the imagination. <a href="#note26"><sup>26</sup></a>Collingwood, however, provides a perfect description of what can go into the making of an historical novel, and <i>does</i> go into the making of <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>. It seems likely that in our dry empirical age only the historical novelist—or the novelistic historian—can truly carry out the business of the historian as Collingwood conceives it. If the first is likely to be misprized because he's regarded as a writer of "feigned or false stories", the second is likely to be depreciated because he's too liberal in the use of his imagination. It's against reductive conceptions of the novelist that I assert that Richard Hughes in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is, in a very literal sense, a presenter of Fiction as Truth.

            <a id="note9"></a><sup>9</sup> A question that must continually recur in the mind of a reader or critic is: "Did the writer intend to convey the meaning or meanings I find in his work?" Generally this is a fruitless question, since the reader or critic has no way of discovering the truth apart from asking the writer. It's worth saying, then, that Hughes became fully conscious of the Danube symbolism before he'd finished writing the passage, but hadn't thought of the meanings I suggested in the description of the rhododendron tunnel until he read this essay. This doesn't signify, of course, that I'm right in the significance I attach to one passage, wrong about the other. Rather it points to the different levels of meaning embodied in a work of literature by its creator—those consciously intended, and those unconsciously embodied. In a letter to me Hughes wrote: ''You know that I rate questioning above answering as the writer's proper function: conscious symbolism tends to serve the latter category, unconscious symbolism the former. Again conscious symbolism tends to be merely simple, to strike a single note of meaning, whereas unconscious symbolism tends to be multiple—to convey a whole polyphony of meanings." The capacity of the rhododendron tunnel description to elicit such a richness of response in a reader (unconscious as well as conscious!) marks it out as a profounder product of Hughes's art than the Danube passage.<br/>
            <a id="note10"></a><sup>10</sup> The four lines of Augustine's poem appear, with little difference, in the shamelessly Keatsian "Lover Finds Something Out" in <span class="title">Confessio Juvenis</span>, Richard Hughes's youthful Collected Poems (London 1926): "So have I often stood, as by a brim, / In girls' clear minds to watch the fishes swim; / Which bubble to their eyes, or dive into places / Deep, yet visible still 'neath crystal faces ..." (p. 59) Hughes attributed the differences between the two versions to the fact that he quoted from memory when writing the novel. The use of "Oft" strengthens the point about poetic idiom, but its appearance is balanced by the disappearance of the equally painful poeticism "'neath". The two varieties of inversion are common to both texts. The irony directed by way of the poem at Augustine points also, a delicious private joke, at Richard Hughes's earlier literary self.<br/>
            <a id="note11"></a><sup>11</sup> London 1952. In the Pelican edition the passage can be found on p. 81.<br/>
            <a id="note12"></a><sup>12</sup> This 'original' is of course a translation, as are those of the texts of Kubizek and Schellenberg quoted later in this essay. Since Richard Hughes worked from English versions (a sizeable portion of his study floor was covered with 'the record', arrayed spines uppermost), it will simplify matters to refer to them as 'originals'.<br/>
            <a id="note13"></a><sup>13</sup> Hughes would have found references to the specific kind of cakes Hitler liked in his sources. Hanfstaengl says, "He had the most incredible sweet tooth of any man I have ever met and could never be given enough of his favourite Austrian cakes heaped with whipped cream" (<span class="title">Hitler—The Missing Years</span> (London 1957) p. 39).<br/>
            <a id="note14"></a><sup>14</sup> <span class="title">The Schellenberg Memoirs</span> (London 1956) p. 23.<br/>
            <a id="note15"></a><sup>15</sup> Hughes's description might well have been inspired by Hanfstaengl's energetic description of Göbbels: "I always likened this mocking, jealous, vicious, satanically gifted dwarf to the pilot-fish of the Hitler shark. ... He had those liquid eyes and a wonderful voice and a constant flow of malicious novelties." (Op. cit. p. 224.)<br/>
            <a id="note16"></a><sup>16</sup> "Göbbels didn't trust Göring and Himmler not to do him in too once the Purge began (if it did begin): only under the Führer 's personal wing could he really count himself safe." (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> p. 343.)<br/>
            <a id="note17"></a><sup>17</sup> Hughes contrasts Hitler, who is all ego, with the German nun Mitzi, who desires to lose all sense of self in God.

Hitler's conception of himself as the German Messiah is implied in his own <span class="title">Mein Kampf</span>: "And so I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. In standing guard against the Jew I am defending the handiwork of the Lord." (London 1939, p. 66.) It's also common in historical and biographical works about him: see Schellenberg, op. cit. p. 112; and, on Houston Stewart Chamberlain's conception of Hitler's destiny, Shirer, <span class="title">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</span> (London 1960) p. 109. It's fascinating that even a man who <i>never met</i> Hitler gained the impression that he conceived of himself as a Christ-figure. George Orwell, in a review of <span class="title">Mein Kampf</span> in the <span class="title">New English Weekly</span> of 21 March 1940 confesses to being able to feel "no personal animosity" toward him: "The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him &hellip; [his] is a pathetic, dog-like face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little doubt that this is how Hitler sees himself." (<span class="title">Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters</span>, Vol. 2 (Penguin 1970) p.28.)<br/>

            <a id="note22"></a><sup>22</sup> "In this poem, Jehovah's appearance during storm and earth-quake. as a vengeful and angry God, marks the annihilation of his foes but the protection of those that trust him."

            <a id="note26"></a><sup>26</sup> It's worth remarking, however, that no less an authority on Hitler than Alan Bullock has recognized the historicity of <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span>. In the Pelican edition of <span class="title">Hitler, a Study in Tyranny</span> a footnote on p. 113 refers his reader, "for a graphic reconstruction of the whole episode" of the Munich <i>putsch</i>, to The Fox in the Attic. Hughes had previously used Professor Bullock's book as a source for his novel!
