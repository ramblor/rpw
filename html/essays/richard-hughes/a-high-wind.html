            The intention of this essay is to examine some facets of Richard Hughes's irony in <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>. I do not intend to discuss the 'ideas' in or behind the novel—though some of these may be revealed through a treatment of the irony. Rather I wish to concentrate on the language and texture of the novel, its main sources of ironic life, and some intricacies of the author's narrative technique. It is a book which has had far less critical attention than it deserves—perhaps on account of its very vividness and readability—yet it has a compression and an impact which in themselves should entitle it to our considered respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            A passage from the early pages of the novel furnishes an excellent introduction to Richard Hughes's ironic method: the existence of the Bas-Thornton children centres around their bathing-pool:
        </p>
        <p>
            There were trees all round: enormous fluffed cotton trees, with coffee trees between their paws, and log-wood, and gorgeous red and green peppers: amongst them, the pool was almost completely shaded. Emily and John set tree-springes in them - Lame-foot Sam taught them how. Cut a bendy stick, and tie a string to one end. Then sharpen the other, so that it can impale a fruit as bait. Just at tilt-base of this point flatten it a little, and bore a hole through the flat part. Cut a little peg that will just stick in the mouth of this hole. Then make a loop in the end of the string: bend the stick, as in stringing a bow, till the loop will thread through the little hole, and jam it with the peg, along which the loop should lie spread. Bait the point, and hang it in a tree among the twigs: the bird alights on the peg to peck the fruit, the peg falls out, the loop whips tight round its ankles: then away up out of the water like pink predatory monkeys, and decide by 'Eena, deena, dina, do', or some such rigmarole, whether to twist its neck or let it go free - thus the excitement and suspense, both for child and bird can be prolonged beyond the moment of capture. (Penguin ed. pp. 8-9)
        </p>
        <p>
            The factual, virtually monosyllabic, step-by-step instruction as to how to set a springe is disarmingly facile. Repetition of the key-nouns (stick, string, hole, peg, loop) and of the adjective "little" (with its suggestion of small-scale innocence) engages the concentrating reader in the process to the exclusion of any moral concern with the ends of that process. The imperative form of the instruction (Cut&hellip; tie&hellip; sharpen, etc) places the reader in the position of John and Emily - he too becomes a tyro learning how. The factual description leads effortlessly into the actual capture of the bird, and readers, totally involved, are themselves "pink predatory monkeys" upon whose rigmarolish whims the freeing or the strangling of the prey depends. The reader is trapped for a moment in a moral dilemma: humanity demands that he recoil from the amoral violence of the monkeys—yet he is unable to judge them because, willy-nilly he has been tricked into identifying with them. <a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> The writer has succeeded in grafting onto the reader's adult sensibility the amoral viewpoint of the child. Before the dislocation becomes acute, however, the narrator relents: "thus the excitement and suspense, both for child and bird, can be prolonged beyond the moment of capture." Events are abruptly distanced and impersonalized, the reader regains detachment and is able to view victim and victimizers from the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why does Richard Hughes want us to appreciate the child's-eye view of things? The question perhaps contains its own answer: we have forgotten what it is like to be children—we must learn again. Yet we can never again be children merely: the passage is a fine example of Hughes's ability to involve the reader - to set up tensions which provoke a complex response.
        </p>
        <p>
            The description has more than local significance, however. It is in fact an encapsulation of the whole novel's plot, a moral lesson in microcosm. Here the children are captors: later in their turn they will he captives (perhaps one should write 'captives' - it is not difficult to regard them from an ironic standpoint as the 'captors' of the pirates'). Yet without a doubt "excitement and suspense" will he prolonged for both parties on the schooner. And whilst they remain there, life and death for the children will be matters of chance, to be treated just as factually as the fate of the bird.

            There are two major sources of irony in <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>. The first is the continual exploitation of the differences between how events <i>really</i> happened and how, on the other hand they are said and believed to have happened. The irony is one of discrepancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not one of the characters can lay claim to an authoritative grasp of 'reality' in the novel. The children, their parents, the pirates, Captain Marpole, the murder court—all 'see' events through different eyes, though some see less obscurely, less dishonestly or less hypocritically than others. Thus there is no simple comic distinction between 'appearance and reality', but often several levels of confusion. Richard Hughes's whipping-post is the chimera of  'objective truth'. The novel's ironic lesson is that no such thing exists. The only authoritative voice as far as a 'true' statement of events is concerned is that of the 'narrator', <a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> but behind it stands the novelist, who, of course, has invented everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the definitive version given us by the narrator, it would be possible to view the capture of the <span class="title">Clorinda</span> from several other angles. We have Captain Marpole's testimony, but it would be possible to get a different story from the pirates (Jonsen is later angry and amused by Marpole's lies) and a fourth one from the children, shut up in the deck-house, with its inevitable youthful misunderstandings—for example of the identity of the enigmatic "fairies". I want to concentrate attention, however, on Captain Marpole's letter: this weird and wonderful document draws its initial force from being the version first encountered by the reader. A piece of masterly understatement precedes it: "Captain Marpole's letter was not so terse and vivid as the children's had been: still, for the news it contained, I give it in full" (p. 43). Naturally we expect an innocuous progress-report on the voyage so far. The first sentence of the letter, however, is peculiar and puzzling: "HONOURED SIR AND MADAM, - I hasten to write to you to you to relieve you of any uncertainty!" It is breathless and ambiguous: uncertainty about what? Mr and Mrs Bas-Thornton have no reason to be other than absolutely certain as to the ship's destination: the effect is to pique us, to inculcate uncertainty in us—not to relieve it! The prosaic factuality of the letter's opening with its piled-up clauses modulates half-way through the first paragraph into total fabrication—a fabrication rendered oddly fastidious by the use of words such as "rudely," "peremptory" and the archaic 'instanter". When he comes to the ransacking of the vessel Marpole's punctuation disappears in favour of a series of ands as he rushes breathily on. The fatuous detail of his account (down to mentioning the fate of the cabin bell-pulls, and including an inventory of the <span class="title">Clorinda</span>'s cargo), is matched only by the fancifulness of his lies in which among other things his nine hundred pounds of specie suddenly increases to "some five thousand pounds in all mostly my private property!" (p 44) In his headlong eagerness to disclaim responsibility for losing the contents of his ship, however, he complicates matters somewhat by giving two separate and conflicting stories of the children's fate. First we hear that the pirate captain "murdered them every one"; then in his final paragraph:
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one point on which you will still feel some anxiety, considering the sex of some of the poor innocents, and on which I am glad to be able to set your minds at rest, the children were taken onto the other vessel in the evening and I am glad to say there done to death immediately and their little bodies cast into the sea as I saw with great relief with my own eyes. There was no time for what you might fear to have occurred and this consolation I am glad to be able to give you - (p. 45)
        </p>
        <p>
            Which of the accounts are we to believe? They agree in asserting that the children have been murdered, but the straight contradictions over time and place can hardly make us feel confident about the general trustworthiness of Marpole as observer. The words "glad&hellip; immediately&hellip; great relief&hellip;" impart a grotesquely comic paradoxicality to the passage—and when we consider that the substance of Marpole's fears (if not the manner) are to be realised in Margaret's case and barely avoided in Emily's, ironies by anticipation are added to the letter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again there are several possible versions of the murder of the Dutch captain: the narrator's definitive account; that believed by the pirates, based on the purely circumstantial presence of Margaret on the top step of the companionway, which leads them to drop her unceremoniously overboard; and third, the obscure and imaginary version suggested to the courtroom by Emily's hysterical testimony—itself a series of fragmentary impressions of the captain's <i>death</i> rather than his <i>murder</i> (and so, strictly irrelevant), which the court accepts as evidence not because of its conclusiveness (it has none) but because (a) it has the force of an emotional depth-charge and (b) because the court has already made up its mind that the pirates are guilty (who else could have done it?) and only wants 'confirmation' of this conviction. That the pirate crew should lie condemned to death by the inchoate testimony of the actual murderess's confession is at once supremely ironic and grotesquely instructive.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also interesting to compare tlie actual and imagined fates of Margaret on the schooner. The one character who believes she knows what happened to the girl is her "small, yellow, fanatical-looking aunt," who tells Mathias the prosecuting counsel: "'It's no good questioning Margaret&hellip; but it ought to be perfectly clear to you what has happened'." (p. 181) His answer—"'Then I am afraid I must'"—reveals the gulf separating the aunt's reliance on her feminine intuition and the barrister's (and the law's) masculine dissatisfaction with "probabilities" - "'what we need is something definite'"—and thirst for facts in a situation where no one can supply them. The little the reader knows of what actually took place (and the narrator is deliberately scant here, leaving events to be elaborated in the reader's imagination) reveals a psychological and ironic depth beyond the grasp of either intuition or surmise: "At first she seemed exaggeratedly frightened of all the men but then she had suddenly taken to following them about the deck like a dog - not Jonsen, it is true, but Otto especially." (pp. 100-101)  The twofold modification of the verb "frightened" gives the clause a telling resonance: the reader revises his condemnation of the pirates' sexual mores and places a moral exclamation-mark against the thirteen-year-old Margaret's apparently reciprocal fascination. The prevention here of a simple black-and-white view of child-adult sexual relations demands comparison with a more recent one: Vladimir Nabokov, <a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a>in making Lolita (at the tender age of twelve no longer a virgin), the seducer and not the seducee of the infatuated but scrupulous Humbert Humbert, both softens the impact of Humbert's behaviour and complicates the reader's moral and comic response. <a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is clear that Richard Hughes considers such things as 'truth' and 'reality' relative phenomena: no one character, in any case, has a monopoly of them. The futility—nay, the disaster— potential in taking action in a situation where one believes oneself to be in command of 'facts' that cannot be verified empirically is fully portrayed by the novelist in the trial-scene, which I discuss below.

        <p>
            The second major source of irony is the exploitation of the discrepancy between the ways in which adults' and children's minds work. It is wrong however to draw a simple barrier between children and grown-ups: we see radical differences in the mental make-up of different children; after all, they too are individuals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Chapter One is largely the story of the effect of two natural phenomena on the character—earthquake and thunderstorm. Richard Hughes uses these as touchstones on which to present and elaborate those characters both old and young. The earthquake has an intense immediate effect on John and Emily, galvanising them into a tremendous release of energy when before they had been weakly quiescent—literally an electrification—but in the long term only Emily seems to value it, and to value it for <i>itself</i>: "there was nothing, no adventure from the hands of God or Man, to equal it" ( p. 22). Heaven, it seems to her, has tested her with its utmost test. "Life seemed suddenly a little empty: for never again could there happen to her anything so dangerous, so sublime." Its importance for her is almost purely symbolic - symbolic of the height of peril which the elemental world confronts her with. In real terms, of course, it is insignificant. To John it is the ponies that matter; to the Creole Jimmie Fernandez it is nothing more than something to make the hens lay; to Martha the black maid it is a dust-creating household nuisance. But to Emily the earthquake is as important as both the thunderstorm and the kidnapping are unimportant. It is precisely these latter which bulk large in the minds of Mr and Mrs Bas-Thornton. After her rescue and during the passage to England, Emily is courted by the "wise" Miss Dawson, but when considering experiences fit to compare with her companion's she feels distinctly inferior: "Now she would be eleven in a few months: a great age: and in all that long life, how little of interest or significance had happened to her! There was her Earthquake, of course, and she had slept with an alligator&hellip;" (p 169) but she never dares tell Miss Dawson of her earthquake: "Suppose that to Miss Dawson earthquakes were as familiar as railway trains: the fiasco would be unbearable." The very exoticism of her early life as well as her childishness, creates impassable barriers between them. Yet Emily is right, if right for the wrong reason: Miss Dawson is vicariously interested in hearing of the 'horrors' of life on board the pirate ship and these Emily either considers insignificant or is at pains to forget. The thunderstorm is pregnant with death and is the cue for the Bas-Thornton parents to conceive the plan of sending their offspring to the comparative safety of England—an abiding irony, as this apparently harmless procedure directly precipitates the main events of the tale. The parents ponder the physical and psychological dangers of the Jamaican climate, in so doing totally misinterpreting the reactions of their children to the storm. The children's silence about it they take as a lasting fear born out of suffering, whereas in fact it betokens indifference. The narrator knowingly comments: "Children have little faculty of distinguishing between disaster and the ordinary course of their lives." (p. 32) As far as Emily is concerned:<br/>
            <br/>
            If Emily had known this was a Hurricane, she would doubtless have been far more impressed, for the word was full of romantic terrors. But it never entered her head: and a thunderstorm, however severe, is after all a commonplace affair. The mere fact that it had done incalculable damage, while the earthquake had done none at all, gave it no right whatever to rival the latter in the hierarchy of cataclysms: an Earthquake is a thing apart. (p. 32)
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless the thunderstorm is significant in Emily's life, bringing with it her first contacts with death. The two deaths it causes have very different effects on the children. That of old Sam is dramatic, and when Mr Bas-Thornton carries his body into the house "Emily and John&hellip; were thrilled beyond measure at the way he dangled" (p 27). The death of their cat Tabby, on the other hand, is demonic and mysterious: "He seemed like one inspired in the presence of Death, he had gone utterly Delphic"<a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a> (p. 26), and when the children fall into drunken sleep it is "a sleep over which the appalling fate of Tabby, torn to pieces by those fiends almost under their very eyes, dominated with the easy empire of nightmare" (p 30). As they are children and have no 'knowledge' or 'understanding' of what death involves, it is the way in which the deaths act on their imaginations which is important: old Sam is clearly seen to meet his end—nothing about it compels their uninhibited imaginations; but the memory of Tabby's fate, obscure but hellish, haunts Emily to the end of the book, where it is brought forcefully back to the surface of her thoughts by "The terrible look on Jonsen's face as his eyes met hers" (p 190). What is common to man and tomcat, and written with horrific immediacy on their faces, is their grotesquely esoteric apprehensions of the imminence of their deaths. Sam's, by contrast, is distanced, puppet-like, unreal - lacking in compulsive power. The narrator's dry comment that "there is, after all, a vast difference between a negro and a favourite cat" (p. 32), seems to be thrown in as a light ironic quip designed to provoke the reader rather than a serious attempt to provide a satisfactory explanation of the children's reactions, though (as usual) it is not entirely without truth. The net result of these fatal events on the reader is to leave him with the kind of dual perspective I discussed in section 1: morally mortified by the children's amorality before human death, but simultaneously compelled to understand and appreciate their point of view.

        <h4>4.</h4>
        <p>
            I have discussed two sources of ironic vitality so far, treating separately for the sake of discursive lucidity what are in fact very closely related thematic ideas. Indeed, in some instances they are so interwoven and interdependent that it would be a fruitless and artificial undertaking to attempt to unravel their threads. The events leading up to the trial and the trial itself comprise the most complex instance in the novel. Here the irony expands into satire: from treating the foibles of individuals the writer moves on to satirize a whole system. The butt is Justice. Justice is man's attempt to punish the wicked, reward the good; but in order to carry these things out one must first be able to distinguish between the two extremes. In the body of the novel we have seen what 'natural' justice - that dispensed by the inscrutable Conradian universe - amounts to: when, for example, Sam steals the handkerchief, he takes the distant thunder's growling as "grudging assent," and though it increases in volume, continues to ignore the warning; at the height of the lightning, he gives back the handkerchief, but this act fails to save him; his hut bursts into flames, he appears throwing stones at the sky, and then: "there was another blinding flash, and Sam fell where he stood" (p. 27). We have observed the justice meted out to the Dutch captain, whose mortal offence is to be tied up in a cabin with a terrified convalescent ten-year-old:<br/>
            <br/>
            The Dutch captain they could see on the floor, stretched in a pool of blood. 'But, Gentlemen, I have a wife and children!' he suddenly said in Dutch, in a surprised and gentle tone: then died. (p. 123)
        </p>
        <p>
            This, though on a far less grandiose and dramatic level, is the bitter and ironic injustice of the Lear universe (where, we remember. Albany's exclamation "The Gods defend her!" is almost immediately followed by the direction: Re-enter LEAR. with CORDELIA dead in his arms). <a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> If this is natural justice, how does human justice, the development of thousands of years of culture and civilisation, compare with it? Can men not make a better job of it than this?
        </p>
        <p>
            The spokesman of the legal system in <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i> seemingly believes that "the natural and proper witnesses are the children. There is a kind of beauty in making them, who have suffered so much at these men's hands, the instruments of justice upon them." (pp. 183-4) It is easy to see the danger of this pseudo-aesthetic thinking - 'poetic justice' literally. Mathias's method is to programme Emily so that she says exactly what he wants - thus her preparation assumes the form of a catechism - a rigmarole upon which human lives depend (we recall the fortuitousness of the fate of the captured bird). When we enter the courtroom it is with Emily, and we see it through her eyes. The face of the Clerk of the Court is the first thing to catch her attention: "It was an old and very beautiful face, cultured, unearthly, refined" (p. 188), symbolic clearly of the face of Justice. The next sentence ironically destroys the illusion: "His head laid back, his mouth slightly open, his eyes closed, he was sleeping gently"—as, indeed, Justice too sleeps during the proceedings. The Oath is administered to Emily and her nervousness vanishes. She trots out her rigmarole, singing out her responses (we are put in mind of worship in a church); she sees Mr. Mathias "in fancy dress"; and high above the sleeping man, another: "Dressed in his strange disguise, toying with a pretty nosegay, he looked like some benign old wizard who spent his magic in doing good" (p. 189) - at once a parody of God and a symbol of civilised man's power over life and death. Amongst another group of wigged men, one is "dialing funny faces". All this renders the happenings unreal, cartoon-like; we are lulled into forgetting that lives are at stake. But the tone changes with the switch of narrative perspective from Emily to Watkin the defending counsel. We become gradually aware of the serious business of the court, of the struggle that is going on. And so the scene rises to its icy climax. At home afterwards Mr. Bas-Thornton shrinks away from his daughter: "Was it conceivable she was such an idiot as really not to know what she had done?" (p. 191). The reader, however, is in a position to see that she cannot know what she's done precisely because she possesses neither the mature moral sense nor the abstract mental capability sufficient to comprehend what is taking place. <a href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a> Those who do possess these admirable qualities, conversely, send innocent men to the gallows.
        </p>
        <p>                                                                                                                                                               
            Emily tells the court roughly what it wants to hear; ignorant of the truth, the court would condone this as a responsible action. There is, however, a secondary treatment of this confessional theme earlier in Chapter Ten; here the child is seen to be irresponsible in telling grown-ups exactly what they want to hear. Young Edward finds himself a centre of interest during the passage to England : "It was wonderful for Edward that everyone seemed ready to believe what he said. Those who came to him for tales of bloodshed were not sent empty away" (p. 168). Edward is not encouraged to distinguish between reality and imagination, so that in retrospect "these springings into the main rigging, these stormings of the galley . . . they had seemed real enough at the time. Now, he had soon no doubt about them at all." The operative word in both these extracts is "seemed" (a verb which Richard Hughes, unlike Hamlet, is fond of): if the grown-ups evince no compulsion to tell the difference between lie and truth, why should Edward trouble to do so? He takes his cue from the adult world. Richard Hughes's master in these matters is Dickens : we recall that Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook accept the "marvels" Pip relates to them following his initial visit to Miss Havisham's house; his insufficient first answers only resulted in him having his face "ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall," and feeling convinced that he will not be understood if he describes the strange reality of Satis House, he uses his imagination to provide a marvellous but nevertheless credible (at least to his audience) alternative. <a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a> Pip later confesses to Joe; Edward too is forced to come down to earth eventually:<br/>
            <br/>
            'Shut up!' cried Mr. Thornton. 'Did you, or did you not, any of you, see them hit anybody?'<br/>
            <br/>
            'Cut off their heads.' cried Edward. 'And throw them in the sea! - Far, far&hellip;' his eyes became dreamy and sad.<br/>
            <br/>
            'They didn't hit anybody,' said Emily. 'There wasn't anybody to hit.' (p. 179)
        </p>
        <p>            
            The dreaminess and sadness in Edward's eyes suggests an interior recognition that the game is finally up: his audience no longer believe what he says, and he must reluctantly admit to himself the imaginative substance of his pretended past. Edward's irresponsible lies and Emily's 'responsible truths', then, form an ironic counterpoint in this climactic Chapter. It is ironic indeed to reflect that while the former are ultimately harmless, the latter are finally fatal. Man's Justice is revealed as being no improvement on that of nature.

            Bait the point, and hang it in a tree among the twigs: the bird alights on the peg to peck the fruit, the peg falls out, the loop whips tight round its ankles: then away up out of the water like pink predatory monkeys, and decide by 'Eena, deena, dina, do', or some such rigmarole, whether to twist its neck or let it go free - thus the excitement and suspense, both for child and bird, can be prolonged beyond the moment of capture. (p. 9)
        </p>
        <p>
            This passage might have been re-quoted for its ironic analogies with the trial-scene just discussed, but I want now to go on to another topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be seen from the passage that Richard Hughes's narrative stance in <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> is morally neutral, emotionally detached—in accordance with that absolute narrative objectivity which a well-known critic and literary theorist tells us is essential to the ironic fiction-writer's method.<a href="#note9"><sup>9</sup></a> It would, I think, be a simplification, however, to regard the voice and attitudes of the novel's narrator as the unqualified ones of Richard Hughes the man. It is preferable to view this 'narrator' as a composite of the man himself and an adopted persona. When therefore I speak of the narrator I am imagining a man in late middle or old age—he points out (p. 7) that it is a long time since he was in Jamaica, so that methods of distilling rum on the island may well have changed. His style has a dated, clichéd, idiomatic flavour in these early pages: we meet phrases like "cheek by jowl", "pushed on", "cock-a-hoop", "an event of the first water"; and a whimsical sense of humour—"the stream had gone about its business elsewhere." With its sudden and deliberate shifts of tone and viewpoint, its laconic interest in human idiosyncrasy, and its specific absence of moral concern, the style suggests its owner to be a man of the world (as, indeed, Hughes was himself) who remains unsurprised by the fantastic, unperturbed by the grotesque, and unmoved by the pathetic.
        </p>
        <p>
            As might have been concluded from some of the points already made, death in all its forms, whether that of man, woman, child, beast or bird, receives a similar unemotional treatment. Consider, alongside the bird-baiting already discussed, the depiction of the two Miss Parkers, languishing in a welter of exotic decay - ruin physical, mental and environmental. The narrator concludes:<br/>
            <br/>
            Not long after this, I believe, they were both starved altogether to death. Or, if that were hardly possible in so prolific a country, perhaps given ground glass - rumour varied. At any rate, they died.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is the sort of scene which makes a deep impression on the mind: far deeper than the ordinary, less romantic, everyday thing which shows the real state of an island in the statistical sense. Of course, even in the transitional period one only found melodrama like this in rare patches. (p. 6)
        </p>
        <p>
            The tone of the first sentence is dead-pan, yet at the same time their starvation is given a weird emphasis through "altogether". The narrator's indifference over the melodramatic alternative makes murder seem a ludicrous game. "At any rate, they died" has a note of business-like finality. The next sentence has a sinewy energy: the claim that this "sort of scene" (implying that it is anything but a unique occurrence) "makes a deep impression on the mind" goads us into asking 'what kind of impression?' - the impression of a moral lesson? (are we to find he has a moral sense after all?) - or merely the impression made by the out of the ordinary? It is easy to miss the fact that the statement is calculatedly impersonal: "<i>the</i> mind" and not "<i>my</i> mind". Then the terms "romantic" and "melodrama", re-emphasizing the absurdity of the deaths, reinforce the detached stance. Compassionate or sentimental feelings in the reader are prevented by this technique.

            The one child-death in the novel is treated with extreme detachment. The narrator believes that children "are human (if one allows the term 'human' a wide sense)" (p. 110), but his practice is to compare them with animals as often as possible. John's death is ironically counterpointed by that of Jacko the monkey - their names immediately point the connection. The amputation of Jacko's diseased tail leads to an "aerial ballet" that ends: "Poor little Jacko missed his hold at last: fell plump on the deck and broke his neck. That was the end of him -" (p. 51). The epithet "poor" is as much condescending and conventional as it is sympathetic; the rhythm and the rhyme give the description a sing-song, nursery-rhyme quality: and "That was the end of him—" carries an almost triumphant finality. On the previous page we were told that the children craned up to watch the circus-like cavortings in the rigging "till their necks nearly broke"; we remember that the children at the bathing-pool were like "pink predatory monkeys": the ironic resonance is inescapable. When a child-neck comes to be broken we read: "John, in his excitement, leaned out too far. He lost his balance and fell clear to the ground. forty feet, right on his head" (p. 78). The narrative interest here centres not so much on the fact of John's death as on the effect of his fall upon the old sailor José, who rides a cow down to ground-level, where the crowd "stood back and let him have a good look at it [the body], and shake it, and so on. But the neck was quite plainly broken." The body has already ceased to be human, having become "it" - something defunct, neither human nor animal, something to be treated with scant respect ("and shake it, and so on" - the narrator cannot even be bothered to list the indignities that befall it); it is a thing, an object whose neck attracts the impersonalizing definite article rather than the pronoun 'his'.

            The child, then, receives a treatment as ironic and uncompassionate as that meted out to any other creature, human or animal, in the novel. Facing the reader with the blatant and meaningless fact of human death, the ironic method refuses him the cosy refuge of sentimentality, continually presents him with the quality of absurdity. We are in an uncompromisingly post-Freudian, post-Darwinian world. Squarely confronted with children as children (if not quite children as animals) and not as undergrown adults, we must recognise at least the partial truth that the child represents a stage in human growth (and indeed, the baby another) as distinct from that of man and woman as the larva is from the imago. We must recognise too the possession by children of their own characteristic fantasies and behavioural traits, their own especial logic and their own ruling amorality.

            I want finally to focus attention on one particular aspect of Richard Hughes's ironic narrative technique. In order to isolate this we can take up the point made in the last paragraph's last parenthesis. The baby of the party is Laura, "and babies of course are not human - they are animals, and have a very ancient and ramified culture, as cats have, and fishes, and even snakes &hellip; It is true they look human - but not so human, to be quite fair, as many monkeys" (p. 110). The feelings which contact with a baby arouses in the narrator he compares with those aroused in him by an octopus underwater—the media in which they live are hopelessly alien to him. The outrageous comedy of the comparison ends with a deliberate thrust at those most likely to reject it outright: <a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a>"Contact with a small baby can conjure an echo of that feeling in those who are not obscured by an uprush of maternity  to the brain" (p. 111). The policy is direct stimulation of the reader's adrenalin. Then, however, he says: "Of course it is not really so cut-and-dried as all this: but often the only way of attempting to express the truth is to build it up, like a card-house, of a pack of lies." Card-houses are fated to collapse, but in admitting that his novel is a precarious structure of lies, the novelist is merely admitting that he is a writer of fiction and has no absolute claim on the truth. No adult can ever know what really goes on in a child's head (indeed, why stop at a child's?). Nevertheless the narrator has undermined his own argument: how is the reader to react? The result, I think, is a complex response: the reader is at once relieved that the writer is not demanding total acceptance from him and irritated by the fact that the narrator seems to be playing with him and refuses to give him pat explanations of what is happening. Compelled to admit doubt and ambiguity into his mind, he is thrown onto his own resources in deciding what degrees of credence or scepticism he is to bring to a consideration of any given event, its particular significance, and its larger applicability. It does not really matter if he rejects what is controversial in the novel's argument—what is important is that he should be stimulated into active response.

            Richard Hughes, grinning behind his narrator's back, shrugs off responsibility for his own creation. His method is diametrically opposite to that, say, of George Eliot in <span class="title">Middlemarch</span>, where the success of the novel depends so much on the degree to which the reader identifies his sympathies with those of the novelist. Thus <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> can be read for its ironic asides on the conventions of the omniscient narrative. For the sake of a novel's 'psychological realism', we accept George Eliot's pretence that her story is a sequence of 'real' events recounted by the novelist herself, who could not possibly have been present at the original happenings  (if only for the simple reason that they never happened). The narrator of Richard Hughes's novel is not typical of the 'omniscient' kind and cannot be regarded as a metaphorical 'bridge' between reader and writer.
        </p>

            Let us take another example. When Emily goes to bed at the Fernandez place we are told: "She pressed her eyeballs devoutly with her fingers to make sparks appear, in spite of the slightly sick feeling it always induced: and then, already sound asleep, clambered, <i>I suppose</i>, into bed" (p. 16, my italics). The supposition<a href="#note11"><sup>11</sup></a> of this last detail threatens to make nonsense of the precise and vividly convincing psychological realism of the forepart of the sentence. It is interesting to consider that the act of clambering into bed is the only act described here which does not require assumption: little girls usually sleep in beds! We are forced, if we are reading carefully, to recognise that the whole scene has been invented: and if one scene, why not all the scenes? Again, though in a different way from the "card-house" instance, we are abruptly reminded of what many novelists strive with all their craft to make us forget—that we are reading a fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ultimate betrayal of the 'omniscient' stance comes just before the trial scene and concerns Emily: "What was in her mind now? I can no longer read Emily's deeper thoughts, or handle their cords. Henceforth we must be content to surmise" (p. 187). Curiously the result of this is not to destroy our faith (if it has survived impaired) in the narrator's control over character and event, but to emancipate Emily from the tyranny of his irony, to give her a mysterious and private existence beyond his ken; it also puts her beyond the reach of moral censure for the pirates' fate: how can we censure where neither we nor the narrator can pretend to understand? It is <i>because</i> this passage is mediated to us through an ambiguous narrator that it is able to succeed: such an admission by George Eliot would he tantamount to saying that things had got out of control.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem that faces us, then, is this : is it possible for a novelist to maintain 'psychological realism' and at the same time to undermine it periodically as does Richard Hughes? The widest significance of the last-quoted extract lies in its implication that all significant 'knowledge' about other human beings is surmise: a truism indeed, but a strange presence in such a context. Those who value verisimilitude and prefer to view a novel as a logical whole may well argue that he is having his cake and eating it. I would argue, however, that Richard Hughes is only taking advantage of the true state of affairs that governs our reading of a novel: that essential double-vision - double-think? - which enables the reader (and the critic) to regard the world of a novel as 'real' enough to be worthy of his close consideration with one part of his brain whilst with another he is aware that it is a fabrication. It is also important to bear in mind the vividness and poetic vitality that infuse event and character in <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>, the fact that the technique of undermining is judiciously employed, and the extreme narrative conciseness of the book, which allows abrupt alterations in tone and viewpoint throughout. It seems to me that Richard Hughes has succeeded in getting the best of both worlds - 'realism' and narrative objectivity on the one hand, and the shock value afforded, on the other, by the novelist's freedom to confront us, from time to time, with the fact that we are reading a fiction.

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>
            <a id="note1"></a><sup>1</sup> This technique has affinities with the Swiftian one of betrayal. See A. E. Dyson's essay on Swift in The Crazy Fabric (1965).<br/>
            <a id="note2"></a><sup>2</sup> For a definition of this term as I use it here, see Section 5 Paragraph 2 below.<br/>
            <a id="note3"></a><sup>3</sup> Nabokov and Hughes also have in common the trick of presenting the reader with a version of an event which is afterwards contradicted and superseded by another.<br/>
            <a id="note4"></a><sup>4</sup> Margaret's behaviour is carefully prepared for. She has been presented as 'grown-up' all along; she regards Mr. Bas-Thornton as being "handsome" (p. 40); it is she who, on seeing the "fairies" disembark, decides that "she had never seen such beautiful young men before. They were slim, yet nicely rounded &hellip;" (p. 68); and it is she who is "stupidly frightened&hellip; the very first night on the schooner" (Emily's words, pp. 99-100).<br/>
            <a id="note5"></a><sup>5</sup> A comic glance at the medieval literary tradition that those near death were visited with prophetic powers (See e.g. Gaunt's speech in <span class="title">Richard II</span>, II. i.31ff.<br/>
            <a id="note6"></a><sup>6</sup> <span class="title">King Lear</span> V.iii.225 (Arden ed. p.214).<br/>
            <a id="note7"></a><sup>7</sup> The disastrous consequences of regarding children as merely younger adults is a classic Puritan fallacy. It is interesting to compare the trial scene in <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> with several scenes in Arthur Miller's play <span class="title">The Crucible</span>, where the intolerable pressure exerted on the child-witches produces a hysteria of accusations and betrayals, and leads to the executions of nineteen innocent men and women.<br/>
            <a id="note8"></a><sup>8</sup> <span class="title">Great Expectations</span> Chapter 9.<br/>
            <a id="note9"></a><sup>9</sup> "Complete objectivity and suppression of all explicit moral judgements are essential to his method. Thus pity and fear are not raised in ironic art they are reflected to the reader from the art" (Northrop Frye: <span class="title">Anatomy of Criticism</span> (Princeton 1971) p. 40.<br/>
            <a id="note10"></a><sup>10</sup> As I have found when discussing this novel with adult students.<br/>
            <a id="note11"></a><sup>11</sup> The narrator is fond of this particular form of intervention. Compare its use on pp. 27, 50, 60, and 121. Variants are "I think" (p. 61) and "I believe" (pp. 6 and 33).
