            The central concern of Richard Hughes's writings, from his earliest play <span class="title">The Sisters' Tragedy</span> (written in 1922) down to his final novel <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span>, is with the vexed question of moral values in a world where 'good' and 'evil' can no longer he seen as absolutes, or even as polar opposites. The difficulty of a fixed concept of 'personal morality', lie sees, lies as much in the word 'personal' as in the word 'morality'. He finds, in practice, that an investigation of the nature of human mores is inseparable from an investigation of the nature of human personality. If the forces that shape the latter—psychological and environmental alike—vary from culture to culture, from social class to social class, so must 'moral values' themselves. The notion of 'morality' must then be replaced by one of 'moralities', each of which will be relative to particular circumstances. And in a world of multiple moralities it shouldn't be surprising if, from time to time, what is 'good' and what is 'evil' should turn out to be one and the same thing viewed from different angles, from irreconcilable perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes's novels, which are as essentially concerned with ideas as they are to present those ideas by traditional means - story and plot, characterization, dialogue, narrative description - consistently refuse to simplify. The complexity of the human predicament demands a corresponding complexity in the novel. Hughes sees no reason why the novel shouldn't encourage a high order of ambiguity. The novelist's role is to ask questions, not to answer them.

            Hughes's first novel, <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> (1929 - 1928 in America as <span class="title">The Innocent Voyage</span>), sets out to explore some of the manifold confusions, paradoxes, ironies and absurdities to which conventional assumptions about the nature of 'good' and 'evil' can give rise. At the same time, in offering an account of the emergence of human personality in the child that takes recognizance of the revolutionary theories of Freud and Darwin, it seeks ironically to explode the Romantic nineteenth-century literary tradition of the child as "originally innocent" which developed in the writings of Rousseau, Blake and Wordsworth and had attained senility in the indulgent sentimentalities of popular Victorian novelists such as Marie Corelli, Mrs. Henry Wood and J. M. Barrie.<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> Adults in an orderly, rational, 'civilised' society, the novel argues, assume children to be by nature good, by definition innocent; outlaws to be by nature evil, by definition guilty (ignoring the obvious truth that outlaws too were children once). Such assumptions are shown even to operate in a court of law, the institution traditionally regarded as the last bastion of objectivity and fairness in a civilised country: preconvinced that the pirates are guilty of murdering the Dutch Captain, Vandervoort - for who else could have done it? - the court is prepared to hang them on the thinnest tissue of 'evidence' it can get. In this case that 'evidence' lies in the inarticulate and hysterical babblings of a ten-year-old (babblings which, had the court known what the reader knows, it might have interpreted not as an indictment but as a confession). The disastrousness of conventional assumptions about what constitutes 'good' and what 'evil' is sharply and wittily driven home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes's children are capable of murder; his pirates of kindness and selflessness. Only a superficial assessment of <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>, however, could see its author's method as a simple inversion of a state of affairs prevailing in the 'real' world. <span class="title">A High Wind</span> isn't in the least schematic; it doesn't present us with the emblematic world of an inverted morality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hughes depicts children as growing slowly out of amorality and egocentricity into a developing awareness of the existence of a thing called 'society' which can make upon them justifiable demands, out of 'animality' into 'humanity'. They possess 'moral sense' in differing amounts according to the degree of development they've attained. Laura, the three-year-old, hasn't yet emerged from that animal state during which, in Freudian terms, the child is still dominated by the id, the seat of the passions: <a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> In Hughes's words: "babies have minds which work in terms and categories of their own which cannot be translated into the terms and categories of the human mind" (Chapter 7 Section i). <a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> The children in the novel between the ages of five and nine possess a limited moral awareness which consists in reproducing their parents' moral dictates in their attitudes, opinions, judgments and prejudices. Thus the children are scandalised when Jonsen utters the unmentionable word "drawers" (5. i). Rachel. the only girl in this group, is said to have two overriding interests—the first domestic, the second moral:
        </p>
        <p>
            She had an extraordinary vivid, simple sense, that child, of Right and Wrong—it almost amounted to a precocious ethical genius. Every action, her own or any one else's, was immediately judged good or bad, and uncompromisingly praised or blamed. She was never in doubt. (7. i.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Her awareness isn't sufficiently developed to be able to distinguish shades of good and bad, or to question the validity of the code upon which her judgments are based. It's natural that her view of the pirates should mirror that of society at large—and ironic that it should anticipate that of the court in particular: ''It was now tacitly admitted that these men were pirates. That is, they were wicked." (ibid.) If conscience as yet poses no problems for Rachel, however, it holds real terrors for ten-year-old Emily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emily's realisation of her separateness, her uniqueness of identity, is the key event in the novel. Its momentousness is emphasized by its placement at the book's precise mathematical centre. Emily feels with a moral complexity inconceivable in Rachel. She can, for example, experience paradoxical feelings of divinity and devilishness at one and the same time:
        </p>
        <p>
            She might go weeks together in a happy unconsciousness, she might have flashes of vision when she knew she was God Himself: but at the same time she knew, beyond all doubt, in her innermost being, that she was damned, that there never had been anyone as wicked as her since the world began. (7.i) 
        </p>
        <p>
            Emily's capacity for guilt is indeed great. <a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> Her realisation of her selfhood doesn't give her a new sense of freedom: instead it makes her intensely aware of the interconnectedness of her destiny with the fates of things and persons outside herself, with "the whole fabric of a daily life"; it is a rudimentary awareness of human society. Nevertheless, the first movement of her newly-fledged identity is a movement of defence, of self-concealment. Emily is a 'person', but she daren't let anyone know. "Why should she hide it?" asks the narrator. "She never really asked herself why: but instinct prompted her strongly of the necessity." (ibid.) Her conscious attainment of her selfhood adds a new dimension to her capacity for fear.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is from Emily's self-protective instinct (the drive Freud subsumes under the term 'Life instinct', "Eros") that the 'immoral' events of the novel's second half stem—her killing of the Dutch Captain, and the court's subsequent condemnation of the pirates to death. The first is a reflex act of self-defence—defence of that "rather pleasing little casket of flesh" (6. i) which houses Emily's consciousness. The second is ensured by her neurotic inability to tell the whole truth—a truth she believes would incriminate herself and again jeopardise her new self. Ironically, the very weakness of the self-preservative instinct in the pirates, and in Jonsen particularly, can be seen as a crucial factor in their downfall. Their altruistic act of self-exposure on the high seas in order to hand the children back to civilisation' demonstrates, in the novel's thoroughly Darwinian world, that the streak of humanity in their nature is fatal to them. They are, ironically, hopelessly corrupted by good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet the final moral status of both Emily and the pirates is complex in the extreme. It's much too simple, of course, to conclude that because Emily is a murderess she is 'evil'. It's arguable that sheer fortuity—a mere combination of circumstances—determines that her sense of her wickedness shall prevail over her sense of her godliness. Her act of murder is certainly evil in the way that any act of murder is that deprives an 'innocent' human being of that which is most precious to him or her: life. But the sequence of events which leads to the murder - the injury to her leg producing the "feverish and nervous condition" (7.ii) which the Dutch Captain's gropings for a knife are to heighten to uncontrollable terror - show her not to be malicious, and her act not to be evil by intent. That part of her motivation (supposing that the strands might be separated) which stems from a desire for self-preservation - the preservation of an individuality made the more precarious and precious because Emily has only just entered into possession of it—is totally authentic and rational, and it's the act of any normal person in a situation of kill or be killed. That part of her motivation which is irrational, stemming from Emily's pathological certainty that the Dutchman is going to kill her, is equally authentic - authentic because a child's consciousness isn't that of an adult: things inconceivable in the adult world aren't so in the child's, for the child's world isn't the same: children's minds "are not just more ignorant and stupider than ours, but differ in kind of thinking (are mad, in fact)" (7. i). In a very real way Emily's murder-act is a product of 'innocence', but this innocence must be defined in psychological rather than moral terms: as the child's lack of understanding of the way the world works and of the logic attendant on such knowledge—a lack that Hughes continually emphasizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though certainly not guilty as charged, the pirates are thieves and outlaws. If we're inclined to stress the injustice of the court's finding we should recall the summary justice they themselves mete out to the person they believe to be the culprit: Margaret. They, like the court, are guilty of conventional thinking: it isn't simply the seeming circumstantiality of Margaret's presence near the scene of the crime which leads them to believe her the murderer: they presume that if she's capable of belying her age in her sexual behaviour (and she a mere thirteen year old) she must be capable of belying it in even more monstrous and contemptible ways: her very youth seems to them to make her crime more, rather than less, horrific. They no more ask themselves the reason why she should kill a bound man than the murder court asks itself the reason why the pirates should have killed Vandervoort. In the event it is sheer chance which interposes a boat between Margaret and certain death by drowning and prevents the pirates from being murderers themselves. The 'justice' meted out by the court then, ironically, is neither better nor worse than that meted out by the pirates it condemns. It just so happens that only some of them are favoured with the luck of a life-saving boat: transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Emily kills the Captain, her act is the logical outcome of a certain sequence of events; when the pirates throw Margaret overboard, it's a reflex action stimulated by horror and disgust: when the court condemns the pirates to death, it's acting in accordance with the neutral and inexorable dictates of 'justice'. In none of these situations is there any place for the exercise of a moral choice. The world of <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> is to a large extent deterministic, if not overwhelmingly so. This is indeed inevitable in a novel which draws so much of its inspiration from the insights of Freudism and Darwinism, systems which are in essence deterministic. <a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a> This same fact explains why the novel's narrator never makes a moral judgment about anything he recounts: <a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> a writer who sees the world in deterministic terms must necessarily forgo the right to judge for his characters will be what his world has made them, not what they've made themselves. So, before the execution, the negro cook declares: "'You know that I die innocent: anything I have done, I was forced to do by the rest of you.'" (10.vii) The circumstances which combine to make a murderess out of Emily are the same ones which make martyrs out of the pirates.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are, however, two points in <span class="title">A High Wind</span> where it might be argued that characters exercise a moral choice. The first is the Bas-Thornton parents' decision to send their offspring to England. The determinist might argue that, as responsible parents, this is the only course of action open to them after the hurricane has revealed to them the insecurity of life on Jamaica. The irony of the decision, however, lies in the way events conspire to make a mockery of the Thorntons' good intentions. Disaster strikes nevertheless. Is human action powerless to avert the onset of evil? A second apparently free choice is that made by Captain Jonsen to return the children to civilisation. Here the determinist might argue that after the murder of Vandervoort the pirates are very much aware that they are marked men: to be found with the children aboard will lay them open to a certain and unanswerable charge of kidnapping (Jonsen doesn't remember the death of young John till the ship-to-ship transfer has taken place). In any case, life aboard the schooner is becoming by the day more difficult for self-respecting buccaneers. Again, however, the decision is fraught with irony, for it leads only to the speedier capture of the pirates: Emily betrays them as soon as she gets back into the women's quarters. Again circumstances conspire to mock good intentions: the desire to do good is productive of evil. The pirates would have been better off tossing the children over the side, sewn up (as Jonsen himself at one point jokingly suggests) in little bags.
        </p>
        <p>
            In dissolving normally-accepted distinctions between what is 'good' and what is 'evil', <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> confronts us, then: first, with a world in which things aren't what they seem, in which a person's moral nature can't be determined from his or her outward appearance or social role; second, with a world in which the actions and fates of human beings seem largely determined by things beyond their control; and third, with a world in which even arguably 'free' moral choices made with the best of intentions turn out nevertheless to be productive of evil.

        <h4>2.</h4>
        <p>
            Like <span class="title">A High Wind, In Hazard</span> (1938) resists simple identifications of good and evil. The hurricane which besets the <span class="title">Archimedes</span> is, like the hurricane in the earlier novel, a neutral force. Viewed from a human standpoint, however, it becomes ambiguous, for it can be seen as either a good or an evil according to whether it is productive of moral growth or degeneration in the seamen on the embattled steamer. For Captain Edwardes, to whom it brings an unsought and unexpected fulfilment, a fulfilment no other order of experience could have given him, it must be seen as a positive good. So, too, for the junior officer Dick Watchett, in whom it makes possible a growth into 'maturity' (though 'maturity', the narrator implies, agreeing with Conrad in <span class="title">The Shadow Line</span>, can't be regarded as an absolute, or an achievement secure once attained<a href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a>). But for Mr Rabb the supernumerary, whom it plunges into a state of paralysing fear and reduces to a grovelling animal. and whose career it effectively destroys, it must be seen as a positive evil. The hurricane is an ambiguous force in another way. Edwardes discovers from Captain Abraham, the commander of the ship that comes to the rescue of the <span class="title">Archimedes</span> when the storm has dropped, that a tidal wave created by it has engulfed a whole town, killing its two thousand inhabitants. "That same tidal wave, which, by lifting them over the reefs, had saved then-lives!" (13.iii.) Edwardes attributes this miracle, and his loss of not a single man (the Chief Engineer, Mr. McDonald, has yet to fall overboard), to the fact that "the Lord our God is very merciful!" (ibid.) The present writer is inclined to attribute as much, and as little, relevance to this belief as to the celebrated and conflicting ones by Edgar and Gloster about the morality of the gods presumed to govern the universe of <span class="title">King Lear</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether such a phenomenon as a hurricane is 'good' or 'evil' is, then, a relative question. It is through the medium of the hurricane, however, that Hughes is able to isolate a moral positive that serves to offset the mockery that is the moral world of <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Freud saw the basic aim of psycho-analysis as being to render conscious in a person what previously had been unconscious. <a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a> The paradoxical value of the extreme phenomenon lies in its potential as catalyst, in its ability to force to the surface of a man's mind moral truths about himself that before have lain dormant. <a href="#note9"><sup>9</sup></a> The process of self-discovery is a making conscious of the unconscious. Emily's realisation is an enforced instance of this kind: the narrator comments that there was "little reason &hellip; why it should not have happened to her five years earlier, or even five later; and none, why it should have come that particular afternoon." (6. i.) The discovery made by Mr. Buxton, first mate of the <span class="title">Archimedes</span>, of the reason why he first went to sea is of the same order of importance for In Hazard as Emily's realisation of her identity for <span class="title">A High Wind</span>.<a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a> "It was because he liked virtue: and was not the Economic Man." (10. i.) Mr. Buxton had always wanted to be a professional man; the crucial difference between the two is that "whereas the Economic Man looks on work as the means to get money, the professional man looks on money as the means to do work." (ibid.) The narrator readily recognises the paradoxes inherent in Buxton's chosen profession:
        </p>
        <p>
            As a profession, though, sea-going seems something of an anomaly: for is not its mainspring Trade? Yes, it is a Colossus with each foot planted in a different set of values. I mean, the <i>raison d'être</i> of it is economic, and yet the practice of it is judged by standards which are not economic at all, which can only be called moral: and which are peculiar to it. For the working of a ship calls for certain qualities—virtues, if you like—which do not seem to be appropriate today to the relations of employers and employed on shore. The shore-labourer's liability is limited: the seaman's is unlimited. The seaman may be called on to give the utmost that he is able, even to laying down his life. That is not an imposition on him, a piece of chicanery on the part of his employers: it is inherent in the profession he practises. A necessary draw-back?—Oddly enough, it even seems to be the reason why certain men. such as Mr. Buxton, embrace that profession in the first place. (10. i.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Buxton's reason for going to sea would seem to hold true, in greater or lesser degree, for many seamen—whether consciously aware of it or not. But why should a man be drawn to the practice of virtue? The narrator gives the only answer he's capable of: "I can only suppose that Virtue (using the word in its Roman rather than its Victorian sense) is a natural instinct with some men : they really cannot be happy unless they can give it an outlet." <i>Natural instinct</i>: it's the same thing that caused Emily's concealment of the fact of her selfhood. Hughes seems concerned to emphasize that the human urge towards virtue is also a fundamental force: Mr. Buxton's discovery is of something <i>innate</i>. His positive act of instinct balances Emily's negative act. Going to sea for Buxton is as altruistic as it is possible for any human act to be which results from a whole complex of motivating factors. conscious and unconscious - as altruistic as that of the pirates in risking capture to give up the children; unlike the pirates' action. however, it isn't mocked by circumstances. It's true, of course, that the <span class="title">Archimedes</span> "remains afloat as much by accident as endeavour",<a href="#note11"><sup>11</sup></a> and that there's real irony here: it's true that the fight put up by the seamen (though not Captain Edwardes) is motivated by a desire to save their skins: yet there are truths that antedate both of these, truths that are causes where these are effects, truths implicit in Buxton's discovery. They are these: not only that selfhood must be risked in order that men may grow, but that for some men the risk is integral to the way their lives must be lived. <a href="#note12"><sup>12</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            But it must be acknowledged that there is no absolute which can be termed 'altruism'. The pirates had strong selfish reasons for wanting the children off their schooner; Mr. Buxton in going to sea was responding to a deep-seated psychological need. The philanthropist who gives away thousands satisfies a personal desire. The world of <span class="title">In Hazard</span> can be seen to be as deterministic in its nature as that of <span class="title">A High Wind</span>. How far can it be said that Mr. Buxton truly "chose" his profession? "Natural instinct," on the one hand, drove him to seek a profession that would allow him to practise virtue; social circumstances, on the other, restricted his field of choice, for, as the narrator says, "Sea-going is almost the only profession open to the poor man." (10. i.) Only if he'd been a different man, we must conclude, could Mr. Buxton have 'chosen' other than he did.
        </p>
        <p>
            The relative nature of human moral values is most thoroughly illustrated in <span class="title">In Hazard</span> by way of a contrast between the Englishman Dick Watchett and the Chinaman Ao Ling. They are the same age, yet their life-styles have been so utterly different that it's impossible to conceive of any mutual understanding existing between them. So the narrator states: "Where men's environment. their education, differ fundamentally, flowers from the same hidden root will <i>seem</i> to bear no kinship: will differ 'fundamentally' too." (10. iii.) If Dick's childhood is fairly typical of an English boy's, Ling's is most untypical of that of a young Chinese. Dick's progression through various stages of religious belief, through changing conceptions of God, is authentically, even familiarly traced (though here, as with Emily, Hughes's ability to depict the workings of the child mind is startlingly original). If Dick, however, is "a very normal young man" (14. iv), conventional and orthodox in his attitudes and behaviour, Ling is in every way a rebel—against his father, the gods, the prevailing political system. Yet Ling's unconventionality should be seen not as the response of a free and self-determining will, but as the result of psychological factors active in him from infancy. The key to his nature seems to lie in one of his earliest memories:
        </p>
        <p>
            The whole family were straddling the thatched roof of their cottage. The yellow flood-water swirled around them, and the mud walls beneath them were melting away. I suppose their peril was pretty acute. Ling was lying in his mother's arms. He must have been very young then: for presently she save him suck.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, hardly had the milk begun to come when suddenly his father tore him from her breast, and tossed him, howling furiously, into the rescue-boat which had just drawn near. (10.v)
        </p>
        <p>
            The first paragraph is understated, lacking completely in tonal stress. When it comes, then, the father's action, accentuated by the energetic and alliterating verbs "tore" and "tossed", seems all the more gratuitously violent. The passage gains in impact from its placement at the chapter's end. How many Freudians would ignore the implication that Ling's rejection of all forms of authority is the result of an undissolved Oedipus complex?
        </p>
        <p>
            Ling's first overt act of rebellion takes place during a year of famine when he is seven. After witnessing the almost magical ease with which a lone small gatekeeper repulses a crowd of more than a thousand starving people from the door of a rich and well-provided man, Ling goes out to the fields and destroys the country-gods - by whose presence he is afterwards haunted. At the age of twelve he runs away from home, travelling widely and getting work where he can. In 1927 he deserts from the Kuomintang flag to the Red Army - a further act of revolt which is to lead to his "conversion" (10. iii) to a new 'religion': <a href="#note13"><sup>13</sup></a> "He absorbed the Marxian doctrine like a thirsty animal drinking. It refreshed every corner of his soul. For it freed him from his three great fears: fear of his father, fear of the supernatural, fear of the rich." (11. i) With the Red Army he withstands the siege of Chingkangshan. Then, during a sortie, he's separated from his patrol. Arriving at length at Canton, he puts himself at the disposal of the Party, which provides him "with a set of a genuine-looking seaman's papers" (11. ii). And so he's signed on the <span class="title">Archimedes</span>, where Dick Watchett in helping to take him prisoner needlessly knocks him out. The reciprocal moral standing of the two young men approaches the complexity of that of Emily and the pirates at the end of <span class="title">A High Wind</span>: clearly 'right' no more lies with Dick than 'wrong' with Ling—they embody opposing moralities, each of which possesses its own validity. <a href="#note14"><sup>14</sup></a> Though I can't claim to understand Ling's stunningly surreal dream in his prison-cell (14. v: it seems designed to resist analysis), we can, I think, discern in the weird dream-figure of Captain Edwardes a composite of Ling's "three great fears". The figure is supernatural in origin and powers, rich in appearance (wearing "a pair of silk Chinese trousers, from which flashed dazzling rays of gold light"), and appears as a sadistic father-figure which, tearing the scales off a glowing dragon from the sea, wrings from it the despairing sobs of Ling's "own infantile voice, weeping to him out of the far years of the past". We are thrown back to the flood-time episode. Ling's belief that Marxism had freed him from his fears is revealed as a sad delusion: his unconscious, released in dream, demonstrates the powerlessness of political doctrine to exorcise psychological demons. Mr. Hughes couldn't but find himself in agreement with Freud's dictum that "the Unconscious is the infantile mental life".<a href="#note15"><sup>15</sup></a> Ao Ling provides us with a classic example of how (in Wordsworth's phrase) "the child is father of the man"—of the psychic determinism such a truth implies.

        <p>
            The actions in <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> and <span class="title">In Hazard</span> take place in relatively delimited situations. The two volumes so far published of Mr. Hughes's long historical novel <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> widen the author's canvas greatly: significant events take place in a variety of countries—England, Wales, Germany, America, Morocco. <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span> (1961) confines itself to a narrative of events in the November of 1923, centring on Hitler's abortive <i>putsch</i> in Munich. <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> (1973) carries the story on to the June of 1934, culminating in a reconstruction of The Night of the Long Knives—Hitler's ruthless purge of the Nazi party. The ideological centre of <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is to be found in Chapters 26-28 of Book I of <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span>. Here Richard Hughes makes his fullest and most explicit theoretical statement about the nature of the self. He rejects 'extreme' conceptions of the relation of the individual self to things and persons outside itself: that, on the one hand, of Cartesian philosophy, which confines the concept of self wholly within the "incontestably cogitating 'I'"; and that, on the other, of Humanism, which pretends "to awareness of every one as universal 'we' " (Ch. 26). The truth for Hughes lies somewhere between the two: "Selfhood is <i>not</i> wholly curtailed within the I." The problem is, then, where the line is to be drawn between that community of human beings and things with which the individual can identify himself—the communal 'we' and 'ours'—and those who lie in "regions of opposite emotional charge"—a recognisable 'they'. Reason is powerless here, says Hughes; only emotion can decide. The answer is wherever in a given context the opposing emotional charges for the moment place it: wherever it brings into balance the feelings of owning and disowning, the feelings of loving and hating, trusting and fearing&hellip; 'right' and 'wrong'. (ibid.)
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the dictum of a moral relativist. The traditional moral absolutes can no more claim sovereignty of place in this historical novel than in <span class="title">A High Wind</span> or <span class="title">In Hazard</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the achievements of <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> is that it accounts for the emergence of the artistic sensibility that produced <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>. It's the sensibility of a generation of men brought up during the years of the first World War to regard "unnatural death" as "a public institution" (<span class="title">Fox</span>, Book I Chapter 26), and to expect a lifespan of only nineteen years. Yet though <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> contains autobiographical elements (pre-eminently Augustine's adventures in Morocco) it's much more ambitious than an autobiography could hope to be. In order most thoroughly to account for himself, a man must account for the period in which he lives: here nothing less than the creative objectivity of the novel will suffice. <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> sets itself to explore the psychological, moral, social and political forces that shaped an era.
        </p>
        <p>
            Augustine Penry-Herbert, the novel's 'hero', is one of those boys conditioned to accept death at the age of nineteen. When the Great War suddenly ends, therefore, he's faced with the problem of what to do with his unexpected lease of life. Augustine, a member of the British upper-class, is happily released by his inherited wealth from the necessity of earning a living. Disabled by education and temperament from placing an easy faith in the traditional values of his class (previous generations appear to him, in the Darwinian terms favoured by Hughes, "like different species (<span class="title">Fox</span> 1.4)) Augustine embodies the moral and intellectual uncertainty of the post-war generation. His continuing quest, then, is for some experience that will give shape and meaning to his life. Yet restless travelling only reveals the bewildering variety of moral perspectives that exist in the world. His inner conflict of duty and desire intensifies rather than eases as time goes on. Perhaps his fundamental intellectual error is his idealistic belief, shared by his friend Jeremy Dibden, that an "age of illimitable human progress and fulfilment" is now dawning, an age in which "the very words 'God' and 'guilt' must atrophy and ultimately drop off the language" (<span class="title">Fox</span> I. 19). In a moment of luminous insight he perceives that theirs was the first generation in the whole cave-to-cathedral history of the human race completely to disbelieve in sin. Actions nowadays weren't thought of as 'right' or 'wrong' any more: they were merely judged social or anti-social, personal fulfilment or frustration&hellip; (ibid.)
        </p>
        <p>
            But, as Jeremy argues, "that lands us with two dichotomies instead of one &hellip; and sometimes they clash". Augustine fails to realise that there is no one fixed entity called 'society', that what might be deemed 'social' in one culture, one country, one class, even one locality, might not be deemed 'social' in another. Augustine is repeatedly to be brought face to face with the implications of the fact that 'personal' and 'social' are at odds with one another, and that, far from being liberated from the tyranny of 'right' and 'wrong' as he thinks he is, he's firmly locked into subservient allegiance to a very definite code of values.
        </p>
        <p>
            The formal structures of <span class="title">Fox</span> and <span class="title">Shepherdess</span> emphasize Hughes's concern with the necessity of a working relationship between 'self' and 'social'. The opening chapters of the first book of each novel focus upon the individual who has deliberately withdrawn  from the social world. We begin with Augustine, first at his ancestral home Newton Llanthony in Pembrokeshire, later in the woods of Connecticut. In each case a chance encounter with a girl-child—the first dead, the second alive— compels him to reappraise his relationship with the social world, to recognise the existence of other persons towards whom, willy-nilly, he must take up an attitude. The formal movement of each separate volume is that of an ever-widening spiral. At the still central point stands the isolated individual, but with his first human contact the arm of the spiral branches out into action, circling out to touch lives at greater and greater distances as the central awareness is compelled to formulate attitudes to remoter and remoter happenings: the lone 'I' is forced to consider the implications of the personal pronouns 'we' and 'they'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Augustine's meeting with Ree by the pool in the Connecticut Woods in the first chapter of <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> sets in motion a train of events that is to lead to his loss of virginity. <a href="#note16"><sup>16</sup></a> This only comes about, however, after several false encounters that demonstrate not only that Augustine possesses a very definite set of <i>mores</i>—in this case sexual— but that they are very different from those of American teenagers. From the start he's "more than a little dumbfounded" (1.12) by the fact that boys and girls of school age should be allowed out together, unchaperoned, after dark. As for girls getting drunk—"It is shocking". "The British upper-class culture Augustine himself had been reared in had tended to 'sex its pubescents in half "—with consequent repressions for the boys. Despite his shocked surprise, however, Augustine isn't inclined to judge this conduct from a moral standpoint, but sees it (as we might have expected) in utilitarian terms: "The fact is he didn't know yet what to think: was this Progress or Decadence?" Uncommitted as it is, this nevertheless carries an ironic suggestion that part of him is attracted by what he sees: how far, indeed, is the stance a rationalisation aimed at quieting a troubled conscience? The dream he has the morning after a drinking session on the roof of his shack of undressing a dead girl who suddenly becomes very much alive testifies to the arousal of instincts too long repressed. <a href="#note17"><sup>17</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It isn't until his misunderstanding with Janis, however, that the gulf between respective moral codes is fully brought out. Augustine, encouraged by her seemingly passionate and committed love-making, is shocked when she draws back "at the very last moment of all" (I. 18). Janis is shocked that he should attempt to overstep "the rules of the game"—rules which allow every satisfaction but that to be got from coitus itself. So, how could those two make it up, when each of them felt so grossly ill-used and insulted by someone without any morals at all? Janis could never forgive his brash assumption that she was the stuff unmarried mothers are made of: Augustine could never accept the idea of a man being used as merely a "thing", without any nerves or needs of his own - as just an impersonal post for a girl to rub herself on. &hellip;s (ibid.)
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to the crunch Augustine is seen to have a very clear idea of what's 'right' and what's 'wrong'. His idealism proves unequal to the trial of reality: the theory and practice of morals are things apart. Augustine's sexual morals are indisputably those of his country and class. In fact, of the two young people, it's Janis whose sexual mores are coloured by utilitarian considerations, Augustine's that reveal the stamp of 'purer' moral values. For the intellectual Augustine, "Conscience is an operable cancer" (<span class="title">Fox</span> I.19), and 'guilt' a word whose days of currency are numbered. His experiences with Ree, however, show guilt and conscience to be things very much alive in his own psychology - and if <i>his</i> generation, newly inspired  by "<i>The great revelation which was Freud! </i>", can't overcome them, who shall? Ree's offer of her child-self in his shack on the night of his recovery of the whisky from the sunken Stutz - an offer pre-meditated on her part, but one with which his own loathness to tell her to leave and his initial move of acceptance towards imply his complicity - he feels "ashamed in&hellip; strangely conflicting  ways" (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> I. 27): ashamed, once presumes, for causing her pain by rejecting her, for almost violating a child, and possibly for lacking the strength to translate his intellectual convictions into pragmatic terms. The complexity of his psychological response is a true reflection of the painful complexity of the human predicament. Ironically, despite his non-violation of Ree, he nevertheless feels afterwards a "load on his heart", a "leaden lump at the very core of his being" that seems to him "mightily close to what people like Mitzi [the German nun] must mean buy 'sin'!" (I.28)
        </p>
        <p>
            But there couldn't be '<i>sin</i>' if there wasn't a God to offend - which there wasn't, of course&hellip; And so, was it Freud whom Augustine in fact had offended against? Or the God Who Didn't Exist? Or would some wholly impartial observer, perhaps, have deemed him in Dutch with both? (ibid.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Augustine finds himself in the crazy position of experiencing the sense of sin emotionally while denying its existence intellectually. As it can't be 'sin' in the accepted sense (for 'God' doesn't exist) he searches for an alternative power that might have brought it into being! Augustine had once condemned Russians for deifying Marx; now he himself, ironically, is reduced to deifying Freud in a desperate and self-contradictory attempt to extricate himself from the moral and intellectual morass into which he's fallen. In recognising the claim on him of what looks suspiciously like a moral absolute ("A-child-is-a-child") despite his nagging doubts ("—<i>or</i>, IS it?") he enables the "cancer" of conscience he'd once so loftily dismissed as an anachronism to gain a signal victory over the iconoclastic forces of post-Freudian amorality, forces whose champion he'd fervently believed himself to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            The polar figures in <span class="title">The Human Predicament</span> are Adolf Hitler and Mitzi von Kessen. To insist that Hitler represents the extreme of 'evil' and Mitzi that of 'good', however, would be to simplify the complexity of the human predicament, and to predicate the existence of a vantage-point from which all human behaviour can confidently be evaluated. The polarity is at base one between kinds of selfhood. Hughes sees Hitler as an absolute solipsist: his self is "contained wholly within the ring-fence of his own minimal innermost I" (<span class="title">Fox</span> I. 26). For such a being, for whom the words 'we' and 'my' are without meaning, "the asylum doors gape". Hitler's psycho-sexual aberrations are seen as functions of his solipisism:<br/>
            <br/>
            how could that monistic 'I' of Hitler's ever without forfeit succumb to the entire act of sex, the whole essence of which is recognition of one 'Other'? Without damage I mean to his fixed conviction that he was the universe's unique sentient centre, the sole authentic incarnate Will it contained or had ever contained? Because this of course was the rationale of his supernal inner 'Power': <i>Hitler existed alone. I</i> am, none else beside me.' The universe contained no other persons than him, only things&hellip; (<span class="title">Fox</span> III. 10.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Hitler's selfhood is comparable to that of the amoral egoistic child as yet unaware of the existence outside himself of other persons with wants and needs as imperative as his own. Emily, newly aware of her uniqueness, toyed with the idea that she herself might be God—though aware at the same time of an innate wickedness in herself. Only further experience—that of being a murderer—resolved this inner dialectic. Hitler, it seems, has failed to grow up: in him the egoism and amorality of the child exist alongside a fully-developed (and therefore insane) intelligence! <a href="#note18"><sup>18</sup></a> Since he exists alone only he is capable of action and creation: were he to die the universe would cease to be! <a href="#note19"><sup>19</sup></a> Hitler's awareness of self is equivalent to the awareness that one is God.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mitzi's awareness is diametrically opposite in character. Her greatest insight, stimulated by Uncle Otto's reading of Thomas-a-Kempis, is that she must forgo even a vestigial sense of self in order "to return to God" (<span class="title">Fox</span> III. 18). Later, in face of an overwhelming apprehension of the great 'I AM' of God Himself, her personal 'I am' fades into insignificance:<br/>
            <br/>
            now, when she probed to her own very innermost pinpoint 'I am', it was like looking into a tiny familiar room through a window and finding herself instead looking out—upon landscapes of infinite width: no longer her little 'I am' inside there at all, but only His great '! AM'.
        </p>
        <p>
            The times when a separate 'Mitzi' still seemed to exist were no more than a lingering nightmare she hoped to be rid of for ever as soon as she woke up after His likeness, a nun: no longer her little 'I will' there ever again, but only His WORD (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> II.1.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Mitzi's ideal, to destroy will in herself, opposes Hitler's—which is to maximise it, to be Will Incarnate. If in her early days at Carmel there's a danger in Mitzi's intense awareness of God's presence, it's inherent in a sublimity buttressed by extreme introspection. What the experienced nuns know she must acquire to balance this awareness—"our sense of community" (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> II. 5), a fruitful connection with others, a shared humility—she herself quickly realises. To be God is to exist in a finished state: what is omniscient is incapable of discovery and development: to be human is continually to be growing.
        </p>
        <p>
            If Mitzi is a worshipper, Hitler is an object of worship. If Mitzi is herself a seeker after fulfilment and salvation. Hitler is an instrument of fulfilment and salvation for others. The Labour Camp Commandant that Augustine and his party meet at Ulm in June 1934 declares that Hitler is "What a Christian would call a 'saint'—there's no other word for the manifest supernatural power working through him" (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> III. 20). "What Hitler has done for us all is to wake us out of the nightmare we've lived in for sixteen years. He has started us Germans hoping again, when we'd almost forgotten how to hope." This Saviour is to cure Germany through the quasi-religious methods of the purge: pogrom and firing-squad.
        </p>
        <p>
            Contrasting with the perversion of religious emotion on which Nazism feeds is the Christian tradition itself, its moral absolutism embodied in Mitzi. Her methods of personal purgation are the spiritual means of prayer, self-discipline and contemplation hallowed by centuries of devotion. Her road too can lead to sainthood, as the Reverend Mother of Carmel reminds herself, thinking of another girl (St. Thérèse of Lisieux) who, a bare generation earlier, had experienced difficulties in getting admitted to Carmel—and yet was now a canonised Saint. At the end of <span class="title">The Wooden Shepherdess</span> it's the Christian tradition which, through Mitzi. is given the last word. It would be naive to conclude from this, however, that Richard Hughes believes that a reversion to orthodox Christian faith is the answer to the dilemmas of the human predicament. Mitzi's spirituality isn't only inspired by an intensity of faith impossible for the vast majority of human beings, but in the novel so far it has been insulated from the Yeatsian world of blood and mire. <a href="#note20"><sup>20</sup></a> For most of us the confused and uncertain Augustine—for whom the extreme creeds of Mitzi and the Nazis are equally untenable—will remain the key figure: for him, and for us, the exploration must go on.

        <p>
            <a id="note1"></a><sup>1</sup> See, for a stimulating account of the child in nineteenth and twentieth century literature, <span class="title">The Image of Childhood</span> by Peter Coveney, Peregrine 1967.<br/>
            <a id="note2"></a><sup>2</sup> J. A. C. Brown describes the id as a "primeval conglomeration' or 'seething mass of impulses or instinctual drives entirely lacking in any directing or guiding consciousness" (<span class="title">Freud and the Post-Freudians</span> (Pelican 1961) p. 28.<br/>
            <a id="note3"></a><sup>3</sup> Only the 'otherness' of Laura can therefore be evoked. Hughes does it in a brilliantly audacious passage comparing the alienness of a baby to that of an octopus (7. i).<br/>
            <a id="note4"></a><sup>4</sup> In Freudian terms: Emily's 'super-ego' - a critical censor only in part conscious - is now fully active. "An explanation of the normal conscious sense of guilt (conscience) presents no difficulties; it is due to tension between the ego and the ego-ideal [super-ego] and is the expression of a condemnation of the ego pronounced by its criticising function." (Freud, <span class="title">The Ego and the Id</span> (Hogarth Press 1927) p. 73)<br/>
            <a id="note5"></a><sup>5</sup> Re Freudism: "The principle of causality is not, of course, strictly speaking a scientific law but rather a necessary assumption without which no science would be possible. But Freud was the first to apply it to the study of personality in the form of a literal and uncompromising psychic determinism which accepted no mental happenings as 'accidental'." (Brown, op. cit., p.3)<br/>
            <a id="note6"></a><sup>6</sup> For an examination of this narrative voice, see my essay Irony in <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>, <span class="title">The Anglo-Welsh Review</span> Vol. 23, No. 51 (Spring 1974) pp. 41-57. And reprinted in this essay selection.<br/>
            <a id="note7"></a><sup>7</sup> After the storm the narrator comments: "It was as if Dick's voice had broken now. He had some fine new manly notes. But the old top-notes were gone. Not, perhaps, for good: the shift had been artificial. In time, security might restore him to his natural range." (14. iv.)<br/>
            <a id="note8"></a><sup>8</sup> For the patient "everything pathogenic in the unconscious must be transferred into consciousness". <i>Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis</i> (2nd Ed., London 1933) p.239.<br/>
            <a id="note9"></a><sup>9</sup> War can act similarly. Hughes himself pointed out the symbolic nature of his hurricane in a fascinating and revealing Preface to the American edition of <span class="title">In Hazard</span> (New York 1966, pp. xv-xxiii). His own growth into a realisation of the hurricane as a symbol of the approaching forces of war and violence is a fine instance of the growth of an unconscious truth into consciousness.<br/>
            <a id="note10"></a><sup>10</sup> Cf. "And then an event did occur, to Emily, of considerable importance. She suddenly realised who she was." (6.1.) And: "Mr. Buxton, sucking his apple on the bridge, suddenly realised for the first time why he had gone to sea (he had been at sea now for twenty-five years." (10.i) The ways in which Emily's and Buxton's insights come to them also demand comparison. Cf. "It must not be supposed that she argued it all out in this ordered, but rather long-winded fashion. Each consideration came to her in a momentary flash, quite innocent of words" (6. i). And: "being so hungry he thought in jerks, flashes of insight which were not connected up as I am putting them here." (10. i.)<br/>
            <a id="note11"></a><sup>11</sup> <span class="title">Richard Hughes</span>, by Peter Thomas (University of Wales Press 1973) p. 66. <br/>
            <a id="note12"></a><sup>12</sup> Buxton's "natural instinct" can't, I think, be accounted for by saying that Hughes is merely making provision for the Death instinct (Thanatos) which Freud sets in theoretical opposition to the Life instinct (Eros). Sea-going is not analogous to warfare. Brown describes the Death instinct as "an innate destructiveness and aggression directed primarily against the self" (op. cit., p. 27).<br/>
            <a id="note13"></a><sup>13</sup> In Hughes's next novel, <span class="title">The Fox in the Attic</span>, the central character Augustine and his friend Jeremy loftily agree that Marxism, ''a science still fossilised at the Victorian, dogmatic level of mere answers", provides a perfect retreat for the religious-minded Russian people. (<span class="title">Fox</span> Book I Chapter 19.1)<br/>
            <a id="note14"></a><sup>14</sup> Walter Allen comments: "Ao Ling may perhaps represent another variant of virtue." (<span class="title">Tradition and Dream</span> (Pelican 1965) p. 84.) <br/>
            <a id="note15"></a><sup>15</sup> Op. cit., p. 178.<br/>
            <a id="note16"></a><sup>16</sup> "A watersnake flashed in the dwindled summer cascade scarcely tinkling into the one pool deep enough to swim in": already in this second sentence unobtrusive Freudian symbolism is at work.<br/>
            <a id="note17"></a><sup>17</sup> The dream connects for Augustine the two significant encounters with dead Rachel and live Ree. His discovery, when he starts to undress her, "that instead of bare skin underneath this child was downy all over with delicate fur; and a fur attractively soft to the touch, like a mole's . . ." places him in direct line of descent from Dick Watchett and Ao Ling. Ling also dreams: "He was surprised to find a Fukienese girl on the cot beside him. He raised himself on one elbow, to embrace her: but the fine hair on her face and hands warned him that she was but a fox in human shape." (14.v.) Dick animalizes Sukie in the waking dreams he experiences whilst pouring oil. At one point she "hopped away on her unnaturally elongated feet, nervously folding and unfolding her ears.' (8. i.) "Sukie" and "Fukienese" chime fascinatingly.<br/>
            <a id="note18"></a><sup>18</sup> Hitler's childishness is brought out both obviously and obliquely. When taken from the Hanfstaengls' house at Lifting after the <i>putsch</i> he's described as "trailing Putzi's prized English rug by one corner like a child who has been playing Indians" (<i>Fox</i> III. 11). An unidentified character wrongly names Hitler 'Egon' in <span class="title">Fox</span> II. 19; an ironic resonance is thus established between Hitler and little Egon Hanfstaengl, who adores him. (The closeness of 'Egon' and 'ego' was surely an ironic windfall for Richard Hughes!) In <span class="title">Shepherdess</span> II. 14 Egon is inspired into a destructive frenzy by one of his beloved uncle Dolf's uncontrollable tirades. He is described as having gone "berserk, completely cuckoo". Later, Hitler himself is likened to a cuckoo-chick (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> III. 16).<br/>
            <a id="note19"></a><sup>19</sup> Thus his behaviour on the Sunday after the purge. In his account of the descent on Wiessee, only he appears to have acted: "Everything rested on me, as alone and unarmed I rushed the swine before they could fire a shot." As Friedrich realises. Hitler is possessed by the awareness that he might have been killed: "For nothing on earth can equate with a solipsist losing his life, since that is the End of the World itself". (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> III. 30.)<br/>
            <a id="note20"></a><sup>20</sup> Yet "a time would come when she had to meet and withstand that roaring lion [the devil] himself. For Carmel was 'in' the world where he walked about seeking to tear such children of God as Himmler limb from limb" (<span class="title">Shepherdess</span> II. 33). Mitzi's presentiment seems to anticipate a time when she and her faith will be tested <i>in</i> the world.
