        <span class="title">Richard Hughes, Novelist</span>  is a critical biography and was the first book-length study ever published of the intriguing author whose most famous work is <span class="title">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>. At the time of its publication it was a controversial best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic and was subsequently filmed. Part One, the first third of the book, comprises a compressed account of Hughes's life. Part Two discusses Hughes's early work in poetry and the short story and for the theatre (he wrote the first ever play for radio) before proceeding to readings of his four novels. Hughes thought deeply about the nature of fiction and this section includes two short chapters on his fictional theory.
