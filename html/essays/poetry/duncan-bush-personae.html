    <h3>Duncan Bush's Personae</h3>
    <h4>(This essay first appeared in <i>Poetry Wales</i> 28.1 (July 1992) pp. 33-45.)</h4>

    <section>
        <h4>1.</h4>

        <p>There are two particular reasons why a poet should cultivate personae. First, to escape the burden of personality which use of the lyric first person has, since the Romantic period, traditionally implied. Some readers are still liable (despite the now-distant event of literary modernism) to identify an 'I' that doesn't obviously seem distinct from the poet's own voice with the autobiographical/confessional mode and hence with honesty, sincerity, <i>truth</i>. But poems often represent a compromise between the subjective claims of the poet's experience and the objective requirements of the poem: when, I believe, many poets put the latter consideration first. The extensive adoption of personae by Victorian poets seems to have been prompted in large part by the desire to get out from under the Romantic first person, to loosen the bonds of self. (That the Romantics make poor dramatists is surely the converse of their brilliance at self-portrayal.)</p>

        <p>Second, the cultivation of persona signifies a poet's desire to encompass modes of being and kinds of experience that are not and often could never be his or her own. The persona is put on like a garment, a sensibility not the poet's own is worn like a mask of many colours. But whilst a great sense of liberation is to be had from this (as if, to borrow an image from a Schoenberg quartet, the poet – his or her own identity overlaid momentarily by another – was indeed breathing the air of a different planet), a constriction of a new kind had to be recognised. Now, instead of a tension between the claims of the poet and the requirements of the poem, we get a tension between the sensibility of the poet and the sensibility of the persona.</p>

        <p>This tension may be said to manifest itself in two particular ways. First, the host poet has to decide what attitude he or she is to take up towards the guest persona. For the persona may entertain feelings, beliefs, ideas that are so far removed in time and space from the poet's own as to constitute a severe test of both empathy and objectivity. Should the poet leave the persona to its own devices, or should the poet 'clue' the reader as to how to view the persona? Even where the form of a poem excludes the possibility of direct authorial comment, it's possible for a poet to undermine a persona. Browning, for instance, has the Duke in his dramatic monologue "My Last Duchess" gives himself away to the reader, demonstrating unconsciously his egoism and cruelty.</p>

        <p>Second, the poet is faced with crucial choices as regards language and style. How far – I shall simplify the pronouns by positing for the moment a woman poet – should she go towards creating an appropriate voice for the persona? Should she modify her own style or (assuming that this is a possibility) abandon it altogether? To this question the one of the poetic is intimately related: should she allow the persona to speak an overtly poetic (i.e. an artificial) language, or one that is prosaic (i.e. naturalistic)? If she opts for the latter, she risks throwing out the baby with the bathwater, leaving herself with language so stripped as to be devoid of beauty, intensity, and interest. If conversely, she opts for the former, she may give the persona a language in which the reader simply cannot believe. But while this latter choice may imperil the success of the feint (i.e. the credibility of the persona), it may also serve salutarily to convey to the reader the fictionality of the proceeding: in the absence of more overt techniques of authorial self-manifestation, the style given to the persona may manifest the poet behind it.</p>

        <p>There has been a considerable amount of interest in writing in persona among English-language Welsh poets in recent years. Tony Curtis has had considerable success with the form, Sheenagh Pugh makes frequent forays into it, and Hilary Llewellyn-Williams's Giordano Bruno sequence <a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a memorable performance. But of those poets born since 1940, Duncan Bush has probably demonstrated the most sustained engagement with personae. He is, of course, a fiction-writer as well as a poet, and so one would expect him to have a developed interest in the creation of freestanding characters. Poems written wholly in, or making significant use of, personae are scattered through his books from <span class="title">3 Young Anglo-Welsh Poets</span> (1974) to <span class="title">Salt</span> (1985). Since then, however, he has produced <span class="title">The Genre of Silence</span> (1988) and the poem sequence for two voices "Are There Still Wolves in Pennsylvania?" (first broadcast in its radio version in 1990) which notably extend the range of his work in this area. In the discussion that follows, then, I shall be examining the response that the challenges of writing in persona I've sketched out have elicited from an undoubtedly gifted writer. Sections II to IV group Bush's earlier persona poems according to the kinds of experience with which they deal; sections V and VI look respectively at <span class="title">The Genre of Silence</span> and the sequence for two voices.</p>

        <h4>2. Workers</h4>

        <p>
            Two of Bush's poems present us with miners speaking. In the earlier of these, "Pneumoconiosis", the miner speaks to an auditor whom one might – if one so wishes – assume to be the poet, but who becomes, as one reads, oneself – the reader:

            <blockquote>
                This is the Dust:<br/>
                <br/>
                black diamond dust.<br/>
                <br/>
                I had thirty years in it, boy&hellip;
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            The presence of a silent auditor is a traditional characteristic of dramatic monologue: in providing a naturalistic <i>occasion</i> for speech, the existence of an auditor makes it outward as opposed to inward, dramatic as opposed to meditative, and thus distinguishes it from the stream-of-consciousness monologue such as that of Eliot's Prufrock. Bush is immediately alive to the dramatic potential of the form: "This is the Dust", with its capitalized noun, is demonstrative and gestural; "Black diamond dust" is powerfully imagistic. "Pneumoconiosis" is an early poem, and the language of Bush's early poetry is frequently literary. He favours rhetorical language, a diction that's harsh, sensuous and physical, and he employs an unusually extensive vocabulary, plundering the dictionary for words not normally found in poetry (in "The Hook", for example, one finds "ellipse", "agronomy", "ambidextral" and "stigmata"). In "Pneumoconiosis", however, he curbs this tendency, and we get a language that marries the literary and the idiomatic. Thus, we have
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            I take things pretty easy, these days;<br/>
            one step at a time.<br/>
            Especially the stairs.
        </blockquote>

        <p>which is wholly colloquial, each line relaxing in a complete phrase; but also</p>

        <blockquote>
            I saw my own brother: rising,<br/>
            dying in panic, gasping<br/>
            worse than a hooked<br/>
            carp drowning in air.<br/>
            Every breath was his last<br/>
            till the last.
        </blockquote>

        <p>in which language is artfully carpentered, the participles astutely positioned, enjambment employed to instill tension, and the closing sentence, with its telling anaphora, clinches the matter absolutely. In the first extract one would have no problem in thinking that one was listening to a miner, but the second destroys the illusion: one is listening to literature, to speech organized and heightened for poetic effect: one becomes conscious of the poet behind the feint. Does this matter? Once upon a time I might have thought so, but now I find myself in agreement with Alan Sinfield when he writes that "frankly poetic language may suggest more fully [a speaker's] emotional state" and that "we will fail to in the absence of more overt techniques of authorial self-manifestation appreciate" certain poems "if we refuse to allow that dramatic speech may be rhetorical and lyrical as well as casual and colloquial". <a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

        <p>In the closing lines of "Pneumoconiosis" the idiomatic and the poetic co-exist:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span class="indent-x">But</span> know me by my slow step,<br/>
            the occasional little cough, involuntary<br/>
            and delicate as a consumptive's,<br/>
            <br/>
            and my lung full of budgerigars.
        </blockquote>

        <p>This begins colloquially (though it might be argued that "know me" is at least a semi-literary formula), modules from the anglo-saxon of "slow step" and "little cough" into measured, polysyllabic, latinate speech, and attains, by way of a bridging simile, its memorably blunt closing metaphor. In that sardonic unsentimental image, poet and persona perfectly merge: whilst it has the resonance of a fine invention about it, it's something I could well imagine a miner saying of himself – it possesses the ring of truth.</p>

        <p>The other mining poem I wish to discuss – "Miner, Abercynon, 1985" – appears in the pamphlet <span class="title">Black Faces Red Mouths</span> (1985). This poem differs interestingly from "Pneumoconiosis" in its narrative strategy: rather than just implying a silent auditor, it builds him – the poet – into the poem. Whilst the earlier poem puts together a number of ideas, and falls into separate paragraphs, this later one represents the development of a single, telling idea: as a consequence it's a more fluid, if not a more impressive poem – and so a poem that it's difficult to extract from. Looking at the faces of "the boys" as they come up in the lift-cage one day, the miner is struck by the realisation –</p>

        <blockquote>
            That's it, that's how<br/>
            it is to them, we're<br/>
            black, the tribal<br/>
            blacks of Britain.<br/>
            When we go to work we're niggers.<br/>
            When we go on strike we're reds.<br/>
            The trouble is, he said,<br/>
            and laughed – black face,<br/>
            yellowed teeth, red mouth –<br/>
            is that they see us<br/>
            in such bloody primal colours.
            <br/>
            And the only thing that's blue<br/>
            about us – and he pulled<br/>
            his sleeve-cuff back<br/>
            to show me – is our scars.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The strategy of putting the poet-auditor into the poem gives it a telling doubleness. On the one hand, the act of writing the poem is an act of empathy, an act of solidarity with the miner whose first person Bush puts on. On the other, the parenthetic phrase "black face, / yellowed teeth, red mouth" shows that the poet-auditor sees the miner in precisely the way the miner alleges "they see us" – in "bloody primal colours". Shown by the miner his status as an uncomprehending outsider, the poet writes the poem to redeem himself – but must, to be truthful, inscribe in the text the very exclusion to which he's been subjected.</p>

        <p>Or so one might read the poem if one were to accept it as a report from the real world. What if it's a fiction, the whole scene a fable dreamed up by the poet? Is it merely coincidental that the blue scars which close the poem (though now reinterpreted in the light of a nice political irony) appeared earlier in "Pneumoconiosis" when the speaker said of the dust: "it's in me / like my blued scars"? This image has a particular resonance for Bush. The uncertainty comes in precisely because on this occasion the language of the poem is colloquial throughout, following perfectly naturalistic speech-rhythms, and avoids the literary. The miner's speech is heightened and emphatic – but no more so, given the trenchancy of its insight, than in real life it might have been.</p>

        <p>Where "Miner, Abercynon, 1985" is impassioned and outwardly-directed, "Hill Farmer, Staring into his Fire" is inward and meditative. In the first line – "Aye, Ossie Jones can talk of wood, he thought" – the words "he thought" suggest self-communion. There is no silent auditor, as in the two miner poems: the reader eavesdrops upon a piece of stream-of-consciousness. The hard-up hill farmer's wryly critical attitude to his better-off neighbour – focussed through their different attitudes to wood – is nicely and immediately caught in the writing:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Aye, Ossie Jones can talk of wood, he thought,<br/>
            weigh ash or beech or sycamore, or this<br/>
            or that, who gets it off a<br/>
            pickup, black-sawn by the ton&hellip;
        </blockquote>

        <p>The farmer's brooding reflections, turning on his intimate knowledge of wood, establish his persona convincingly. It's difficult, encountering Bush's poem, not to be reminded of R. S. Thomas's Prytherch –</p>

        <blockquote>
            And then at night see him fixed in his chair<br/>
            Motionless, except when he leans to gob in the fire,<br/>
            There is something frightening in the vacancy of his mind.
        </blockquote>

        <p>And it may well be that "Hill Farmer, Staring into his Fire" is a direct retort to "A Peasant" and poems like it: the mind of Bush's farmer is anything but "vacant", and prompts the thought that the vacancy reported by Thomas was that of observer rather than subject – a refusal, if not a failure, of poetic empathy. Nevertheless, as was the case with the miner in "Pneumoconiosis", we feel the poet strongly behind the feint: Bush hasn't attempted to represent the farmer's stream of thought in a naturalistic manner (which must have led to something diffuse and fragmentary), but has made his persona the gift of fluent, cogent poetic language:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Me, though, who'd no more<br/>
            cut a sound<br/>
            <br/>
            tree down than saw the arm off a young girl, I<br/>
            think always of the dead wood not<br/>
            the heartwood: trunks of<br/>
            rotting birches mossed like stones: the one dry<br/>
            limb on some old oak, crusted<br/>
            with lichen stars: that<br/>
            entire peeled elmtree, white as bone, the wind<br/>
            brought down one night&hellip;
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The lineation, too, bespeaks poetic artifice: the line-breaks cut across the phrases, working against the fluency of the expression. At the same time, each stanza enacts a diminishment as in it, line by line, the syllable-count is reduced. This (wilful carpentry though it is on the poet's part) seems appropriate to the drift of the farmer's thoughts, as he surveys his bleak existence and ("I / think always of the dead wood not / the heartwood") meditates with melancholy toughness on the inevitability of decay.
        </p>

        <p>Different again is "Drainlayer". Here the speaker – who speaks of earth as his "daughter" and assumes a godlike attitude – is Time perhaps, working both through natural geological processes and through the collective agency of all those who labour on the land:</p>

        <blockquote>
            I made these mountains<br/>
            I undig and heave and<br/>
            bury: laid<br/>
            these ducts dry to the mains<br/>
            <br/>
            with the statutory fall.<br/>
            Now earth to earth, where<br/>
            must return,<br/>
            sure as the apple, all<br/>
            <br/>
            things earthly&hellip;
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here the unhuman nature of the speaker allows the poet full licence: his language can be as rhetorical and unidiomatic as he likes. His vocabulary can stretch without strain to include the scientific "exoskeleton". The result is a proud and proprietorial magniloquence, as the persona casts a cold eye over huge sweeps of time and change: "But I bury my own / work dark. Nothing stands / but me." The speaker calmly devours his own products but endures because he – it? – is abstract, immaterial. In "Drainlayer" Bush hits upon one perfect answer to the problem of style in the persona poem: if you make your speaker a person who isn't a person, the ensuing language may be as poetic as you wish – providing that you make it appropriate to the context.</p>

        <h4>3. Old Men</h4>

        <p>The lordly complacency of the speaker in "Drainlayer" makes the poem an unusual one in Bush's output: he's rarely a celebrant of satisfactions. Rather, he's a poet of unease, dissatisfaction, spleen; of flux, motion, the unexplained event. It's unsurprising, then, that old age should attract him as a subject, and that two of his personae should be old men.</p>

        <p>If "Hill Farmer, Staring into the Fire" recalls R. S. Thomas, "Ulysses Becalmed" recalls Tennyson. But Bush's treatment of Ulysses in old age is very different from that of his great predecessor. Tennyson's hero chafes against his idleness, his inactivity, his role of meting out</p>

        <blockquote>
            Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br/>
            That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            He's haunted by memories of the past, of the "delight of battle" that he drank "Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy". Motion alone seems to him to offer life. His restlessness is nevertheless undercut by a sense of the diminishment that old age exacts: he and his old comrades are not the men they were, and the poem closes by balancing the speaker's desire for further experience against his sense of physical frailty:</p>

        <blockquote>
            We are not now that strength which in old days<br/>
            Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br/>
            One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br/>
            Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br/>
            To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
        </blockquote>

        <p>And the final verb may be felt to enact a faltering even as it adds its mite of defiance.</p>

        <p>
            Duncan Bush supplies the speech of his Ulysses with a narrative frame – a substantial introduction and a brief conclusion. This is a perfectly traditional approach: Tennyson himself employs a narrative frame in "Lucretius". But unlike Tennyson (whose hero remains within the imaginative parameters created by Homer and Dante), Bush transports <i>his</i> Ulysses across the centuries and makes him contemporary, portraying him as a grizzled veteran drinking out his life on a Mediterranean shore, envious and resentful of the rich jet-setting young who sprawl on the beach. This is a Ulysses who, whilst despising what he sees, seems unable to do other than sit at a café table, reminiscing and complaining. He remains inert; there is in him no Tennysonian will to further experience. An ageing playboy remembering his carefree youth, his many women, he exudes the spleen of one whom time has taken out of the sexual game. And yet, he's aware of his weaknesses:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Now nostalgia drags me down. I've lost<br/>
            direction and my days fly faster<br/>
            than a weaver's shuttle. I'm a myth<br/>
            crazed on a wine-cup.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Ulysses's speech is idiomatic and racy, but (as this extract shows) image-rich also. A transhistorical figure conscious of his own legendary status, he connects a past of decorated wine-cups and heroic fatalism to a present that accommodates fast, amoral life-styles:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span class="indent-x">I too had fewer worries</span><br/>
            than the gods until I went to god-built Troy.<br/>
            Life was a credit-card cashed in on youth<br/>
            against my father's name. I left a young<br/>
            wife constant as the speed of light&hellip;
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            We must, I think, imagine Ulysses addressing a silent auditor as he sits at his table. It's this auditor who supplies the surrounding narrative frame. <i>His</i> view of the rich young people on the beach is a contemptuous one, and lacks the note of envy that colours Ulysses' view of them. He makes no overt judgement of Ulysses, but, looking back from the poem's ending, we can, if we wish, read his dismissal of the rich young as perpetual adolescents as an implied criticism of the old man:</p>

        <blockquote>
            There is no coming of age<br/>
            to their extended, playboy adolescence:<br/>
            only age&hellip;
        </blockquote>

        <p>The narrator's language is more restrained and measured than that of Ulysses, which is tauter and more precipitate. Essentially, however, there is continuity here: the narrator prepares the ground for the main speaker, whose language represents an intensification of that which precedes it. The narrator too has his poetry, a sharpness of simile and metaphor, as when he speaks of the rich young having been "born to the soft life / like the boxed Apostle spoons" or refers laconically to their material advantages as "so many keys to open women". "Ulysses Becalmed" is a memorable performance, and it's perhaps surprising that it remains the only poem to date in which Bush has adopted the mask of a pre-existent historical/literary figure. Victor Bal, in <span class="title">The Genre of Silence</span>, will be a historical/literary figure, but an invented one.</p>

        <p>
            "Old Man in Scrumpy House" occupies an ambiguous region half way between speech and thought. The old man seems to talk to himself rather than to a present auditor. Bush again employs a diction that moves between the colloquial and the poetic, but on this occasion tilts the writing more towards the latter than the former. The old man is allowed a vocabulary which includes "Innocuous", "Rhinegold", "electrolysis" and "stupefaction". This suggests, if one reads the poem naturalistically, an educated man who has gone to pot. He takes a grim enjoyment in following a gruesome account of the common practice of cider-makers –</p>

        <blockquote>
            They throw dead<br/>
            rats into the tuns for fermentation.<br/>
            The corpses float sideways<br/>
            for a day, dissolving – fur, teeth,<br/>
            bones, disease, everything&hellip;
        </blockquote>

        <p>– with a sophisticated reference to Wagner. Like Ulysses, he's aware of his lost youth, and his ironic reference to the apple as his downfall – "The sour apple is my slow fall / and fast stupefaction" – recalls both "Drainlayer", where the apple was a metonym of earthly decay, and "Hill Farmer", where apple-wood was much mused upon. This old man is, however, anything but <i>stupefied</i>: his language is precise, his intellect unbefuddled. He sees very clearly what he's doing to himself, and his meditation upon his situation is unsentimental in its objectivity. The sharp clarity of the poem again demonstrates the anti-naturalistic qualities of dramatic monologue: the speaker's language denies the very process of human disintegration which he insists is taking place in him. This leads me to an important point. It is, in fact, characteristic of Bush to grant his personae his own poetic objectivity: his Ulysses, miners, hill farmer and scrumpy drinker all possess a remarkable degree of self-understanding. They reveal themselves deliberately rather than unintentionally. And in doing so they again demonstrate for us the potential doubleness of the persona poem – the fact that the persona is both subjective and objective, a self to be worn and explored from the inside, and an other to be grasped and revealed.</p>

        <h4>4. Widows</h4>

        <p>Duncan Bush has written two poems in female personae, and it's interesting that both are widows. They are very different, however.
        </p>

        <p>
            In "Widow", the earlier of the two poems, the writing again (as in "Old Man in Scrumpy House") occupies a region half way between speech and thought. Here, too, the persona's analysis of her predicament is pursued with extraordinary detachment. Once more the reader confronts a paradox: the widow articulates the experience of losing her identity, of relinquishing her sense of physical embodiment, in a language that's both poised and exact. Against the bleak but concrete details of an outside world held in the grip of winter, she sets her personal sense of dissolution:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Christmas roses wreath the bed,<br/>
            brittle chrysanthemums.<br/>
            The garden benches of hardwood<br/>
            oak grey and<br/>
            weather, empty. Wet dead<br/>
            leaves litter the wet lawn.<br/>
            But I become<br/>
            invisible as the pure pane,<br/>
            where a wave<br/>
            ripples across still water
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            If this poem has literary antecedents, they're surely to be found in the work of Sylvia Plath. Plath is the laureate of mental disintegration, of marginal human states and their correlatives in the natural world. When Duncan Bush writes –</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span class="indent-x">the walled air</span><br/>
            swallows me in<br/>
            a yawn that screams higher<br/>
            <br/>
            than silence,<br/>
            dead as the air in a jar
        </blockquote>

        <p>– I'm inevitably reminded of Plath's bell-jar. Bush and Plath are both literary poets, and the imaginative ground of Bush's "Widow" is similar to that of Plath's poem of the same title.<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> Unlike Bush's poem, Plath's "Widow" is written in the third person, and Plath's steady gaze produces an objectivity which differentiates the poem sharply from the hectic and extreme first-person explorations that appear in the later-written <i>Ariel</i> and <i>Winter Trees</i>. What Bush has done is to marry an objectivity comparable to Plath's to a first-person voice that's descending into neurosis.</p>

        <p>The two poems touch at a number of points (the words "wall", "air", "pane" are common to both, for instance), and the following passages inter-resonate:</p>

        <blockquote>
            The voice of God is full of draughtiness,<br/>
            Promising simply the hard stars, the space<br/>
            Of immortal blankness between stars<br/>
            And no bodies, singing like arrows up to heaven.<br/>
            <span class="indent-x">[Plath]</span><br/>
            <br/>
            Then something panting, breathless<br/>
            <br/>
            listens here – as quietly as must<br/>
            the audible,<br/>
            asthmatic breath of God.<br/>
            <span class="indent-x">[Bush]</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Still, one might expect there to be points of contact between poems on the same subject, and I wouldn't want to insist that Bush is indebted to the earlier writer.</p>

        <p>Bush's speaker makes no reference to her dead husband, who consequently seems to have vanished from the outer world, but also from the inner world of his wife's thoughts. This differentiates the poem sharply from Plath's, where</p>

        <blockquote>
            The moth-face of her husband, moonwhite and ill,<br/>
            Circles her like a prey she'd love to kill<br/>
            <br/>
            A second time, to have him near again&hellip;
        </blockquote>

        <p>The omission of any reference to the lost partner isn't a weakness in Bush's poem, but functions as an essential part of the conception: it emphasises (if an absence can be emphatic!) the lostness of the widow, and leaves her effectively unsexed. Were it not for the poem's title, the experience presented could be that of either a man or a woman; the poem might with equal cogency be entitled "Widower".</p>

        <p>"Farmer's Widow, Upper Tawe Valley" first appeared in <i>Poetry Wales</i> Volume 24 No. 2 (1988).<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> It's a substantial poem (of 81 lines divided into four parts) and doesn't at any point call Plath to mind. In contrast to the disintegration and neurosis of the earlier persona, the farmer's widow seems perfectly calm and self-assured. Her gaze, from the first, is steadily and appreciatively on the outside world:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Down steep oakwoods old as the coal,<br/>
            under the floating buzzard's mew<br/>
            I still walk with the collie<br/>
            and his speckly hazel stick. I can't<br/>
            <br/>
            not love this shaggy river-valley<br/>
            below the three poor, hummocky fields<br/>
            we farmed, now just the few<br/>
            sheep in them, or crows.<br/>
            <br/>
            Gone the club moss and swamp palm<br/>
            and the fern my father<br/>
            found perfect in the anthracite<br/>
            the mile or two downriver<br/>
            <br/>
            where he lost his lungs.<br/>
            Gone a tropical primordium, like<br/>
            the frontier boom-days of those pits.<br/>
            Gone to bulldozed blue shale<br/>
            <br/>
            uplands of forestry replanting,<br/>
            some Alaska of the perennial<br/>
            shade-all, soil-souring<br/>
            river-embittering conifer<br/>
            <br/>
            and a few last, leased private mines,<br/>
            walking horses in and out<br/>
            of the drift still, some of them:<br/>
            a cave, a small black downward dune<br/>
            <br/>
            of waste high on the valley's side:<br/>
            the old deciduous woods decayed,<br/>
            decayed and fallen buried<br/>
            there, so much prehistory.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The style is an agreeable marriage of speech-rhythms and the literary. The widow's speech can accommodate the specialist term "primordium", the wistful anaphora of "Gone&hellip;", an emphatic cluster of compound adjectives, and a double-barrelled allusion that calls up both Wordsworth's "Woods decaying, never to be decayed" ("The Simplon Pass") and Tennyson's "The woods decay, the woods decay and fall&hellip;" ("Tithonus"). The widow possesses that sense of history which is characteristic of many of Bush's poems (perhaps most notably "Navvies"), and a technical knowledge adequate both to invoking huge tracts of time past and to condemning the destructive doings of contemporary foresters.</p>

        <p>Not only the foresters are destructive, however. The second section of the poem expresses despair at the mindless vandalism of working-class children – "boys running rough / and purposeless with puberty" – who have hacked a young birch tree down and left it lying in the woods. "Farmer's Widow" might be called a Green poem, but the poet's adoption of a persona has allowed him to express Green sentiments in an unforced manner through a directly experiencing, apolitical and unpropagandist sensibility.</p>

        <p>The four sections of the poem move from winter to spring. Part three, the briefest, sketches a bleak February. Watching ewes eating their own afterbirth, the widow comments:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <span class="indent-x">Nature eats up</span><br/>
            everything. But only people have to<br/>
            feed off their own hearts.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here, perhaps, for the first time, is an oblique reference to the widow's personal loss: she must feed off her own heart in lieu of having another's to solace her. In the final section, on a cold April day, she comes once more upon the hacked sapling:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Its twigs are dry, unbudding<br/>
            as a besom. Though the unicorn-silver<br/>
            stiff-arced, hewn stump brims a<br/>
            tacky milk: I smell it, taste<br/>
            <br/>
            it from my fingers. And<br/>
            that tearful, quick pang wells<br/>
            up again now through me<br/>
            for the tree and for this<br/>
            <br/>
            season's sap still<br/>
            coming, coming. As this knobbed<br/>
            stick strains to leaf<br/>
            in my tight hand.
        </blockquote>

        <p>This passage finely articulates a grief shot through with hope. It seems natural to take the widow's sorrow on behalf of the wrecked tree as an expression also of her feelings about her personal loss. The dead husband is no more mentioned in this poem than in its predecessor, yet the delicate imagery surely carries a poignant charge of erotic memory. The writing, in fact, is more overtly emotional than anything else we've found in Bush's work. His farmer's widow establishes herself as an observer no less coolly objective than any of his male personae, but that objectivity is at last compelled to yield before the uprush of an irresistible emotion. It's the persona that brings the poet to this emotion, and it's legitimate to wonder whether, writing in his own first person, it's an emotion he would ever have committed to a poem. This is one of the great and liberating values of the persona – granting a poet access to feelings and emotions that, writing out of his or her own personal experience, he or she wouldn't encompass.</p>

        <h4>5. Victor Bal</h4>
        
        <p>In <span class="title">The Genre of Silence</span>, Bush finds the perfect answer to the problem – if problem it is – of literary language in the persona poem: make your persona a poet. The poet in question – Victor Bal – was born in 1898, the son of a St Petersburg doctor. He fought for the Reds in the Civil War, and appears to have been wounded in the leg. Afterwards, he worked in cinema prior to his disappearance during Stalin's regime forty years later. The book consists of Bal's extant poems (a mere fifteen of them), a fictional biography which cunningly interweaves invented and historical figures, and a short story (<i>about</i> Bal rather than <i>by</i> him) which acts as a prologue.</p>
        
        <p>A clue to the nature of the book is provided by the poem – "All the Scattered Fragments" – which forms its epilogue. The poem, an autobiographical one, was prompted by the breaking, by Bal's wife Marina, of an Armenian brandy glass on their final afternoon together (before, that is, she left him). To this breakage, Bal adds two earlier ones. The poem concludes:</p>
                
        <blockquote>
            The broken plate won't<br/>
            <br/>
            fly back together again<br/>
            or the dead get<br/>
            <br/>
            smartly up off the floor<br/>
            like gymnasts, in that<br/>
            <br/>
            magical way things happen<br/>
            in a film rewinding.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Immediately, the imagery reflects the broken nature of the Bal's life together; broadly, it suggests the smash-up and waste that's life in the Soviet Union at large under Stalin. On a third level, it proffers a metaphor for the text now ending, a text that's a kaleidoscope of fragments. The fragments are pieces of testimony to Victor Bal's existence – some self-produced (his finished poems, drafts and partial drafts of poems, a partial autobiography, and notebook entries), others provided by those whose lives intersected with his. But while these scattered fragments of a life add up to more, when assembled, than they mean separately, they cannot add up to a whole life. <i>That</i> is irrecoverable.</p>
        
        <p>Now bringing Bal into close-up, now focussing on him through the hazy tobacco-smoke of history, <i>The Genre of Silence</i> recalls the teasing labyrinths of Jorge Luis Borges. One of the pleasures of the book lies in the gradual emergence of connections between Bal's occasional prose and his poetry – especially the way in which notebook entries illuminate poetic ideas and metaphors. Thus, for example, we find that the orrery which appears in the poem "Summer. Evening" belonged to Bal's father, while the reference, in "Black Smoke", to Daphne changing into a tree gains resonance when the reader happens on a further allusion to the myth in a notebook.</p>
        
        <p>So firmly is Bal embedded in twentieth century Russian history (in so far as it's capable of reconstruction), so cleverly is his life interwoven with those of actual as well as invented figures, that he's fully believable: certainly to one who is no expert on the literature of this period. In a review of <i>The Genre of Silence</i><a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>,Tony Curtis described the book as a "faction". This is not the case. A faction attempts as truthfully as possible to reconstruct one or more actual historical events, and characteristically builds on testimony by persons involved. (Truman Capote's <i>In Cold Blood</i> and Norman Mailer's <i>The Executioner's Song</i> are examples.) Since Victor Bal is an invention, <i>The Genre of Silence</i> squarely inhabits the realm of fiction. Fictional writings often include portrayals of historical events and personages: Tolstoy in <i>War and Peace</i> portrays Napoleon and the Russian General Kutuzov, but <i>War and Peace</i> remains fiction.</p>
        
        <p>The fictive nature of Bush's text declares itself in a number of ways. First there is the short story, "In the Pine Forest", that prefaces the book. Here Bal appears in the conventional guise of a character. Then there is the absence of an identifiable editor/translator together with the editorial material which a writer eager to foster the illusion of actuality would have provided. This absence does, however, throw up an interesting – and, perhaps, unique – anomaly. Normally a reader with no Russian has to savour his or her Russian poets in translation, making allowance for what must be assumed to be lost in that process. But as Bal's poems are <i>not</i> translations – being original English poems written in persona – there is no loss. And because Bal is supposed to be a good poet, the reader has every right to expect good poems: whatever strengths and weaknesses are present in the poems are as much Duncan Bush's as they are Victor Bal's: the former is as much exposed as he is concealed.</p>
        
        <p>A firm personality emerges from this multiform undertaking. Victor Bal is unsentimental, steady of gaze, unillusioned. He has the objectivity of all Bush's personae, but an objectivity intensified by the privations and precariousness of a life lived under totalitarianism: nothing but the truth is good enough for him, and he knows – it's the first fact of life – that truth kills. His poems are made out of experience and – with the exception of a couple of celebratory early pieces – are tight-lipped and bleak. Unadorned and authoritative, his style has a directness and colloquiality that distinguishes it from all of his creator's earlier personae. It's perhaps an ironic paradox that Bush had to create a poet in order to get away from the overtly literary language of his earlier personae. "The Galley" possesses the force of a concentrated moral fable:</p>
            
        <blockquote>
        Let some have whips and wear uniform.<br/>
        Let some have oars and wear rag. Let these<br/>
        be more. So have them shackled<br/>
        at ankle and wrist. Let the galley<br/>
        <br/>
        move. The immense effort of shifting<br/>
        inert mass through seas is well known.<br/>
        A strange thing is, those<br/>
        in the uniform think it's the strokes<br/>
        <br/>
        of the whip which achieve it.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This is quite unlike anything else that Bush has written. He says, apropos of <i>The Genre of Silence</i>, that the story "In the Pine Forest" was the first thing in the book to come to him, and he didn't know what to do with it.<a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later, when the poems began to arrive, he began to think of them as produced by the poet in the story. Thus, it wasn't a  case of imagining Bal and then writing his poems: the poems came and then demanded the biography of their author to account for their source. It's not unusual for persona poems to manifest themselves in this self-surprising way: but the demon that demands expression must be regarded as a form of benevolent possession. "The Galley", of course, is poetry in which nothing is held back or hidden; it offers no ambiguities or richness of language to analyse. But that is Bal's style and Bal's strength.</p>
        
        <p>His is a death-haunted sensibility, and his persona allows Bush to give the fullest and most justified expression (justified in terms of the culture, politics and history which provide the writing's context) to the vein of bleak fatalism that's always been present in his writing. Again and again one finds in Bal's poems laconic realisations of the ways in which death shadows life, penetrating and disabling it:</p>
            
        <blockquote>
        The best that Bessmanov will hope for now<br/>
        is not to lose his nose in one corner<br/>
        of the Ukraine and his body,<br/>
        six weeks later, in another.<br/>
        <span class="indent-x">("Archaic Profile")</span><br/>
        <br/>
        But to move a man dead<br/>
        is to wrestle<br/>
        a sack of stones<br/>
        across rough ground.<br/>
        <span class="indent-x">("Toy Soldier")</span><br/>
        <br/>
        &hellip; like the Party official<br/>
        with his belly split open<br/>
        and stuffed with grain, with grain<br/>
        and blind maggots, we found<br/>
        <br/>
        left by a roadside as a sign.<br/>
        <span class="indent-x">("Peasant")</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The fear that pervades the culture is so paranoid that Bal, in "Night, Day", in a striking flight of black humour, sardonically imagines it infecting even the dead:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <span class="indent-x">While with every swivel-perfect</span><br/>
        change of guard, even Lenin,<br/>
        waxen in the mausoleum, thinks<br/>
        that they have come for him at last.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Tony Curtis complains that <span class="title">The Genre of Silence</span> falls "short of the achievement which might well have been in [Bush's] grasp". He feels that the book ought to be "much longer, much fuller", and cautions potential readers "to prepare for both pleasure and disappointment". For myself, however, I felt nothing of the latter on finishing the book. Doubtless it's the case that Bush wrote as many of Bal's poems as came to him, and published when the flow stopped. But Curtis's criticism misses the point. Twentieth century Russian poetry belongs to "the genre of silence": poems and poets alike disappeared into the Stalinist maw: whatever survived did so against the odds. The very fewness of Victor Bal's surviving poems makes Bush's political/historical point with a poignancy the equal of the experience they express.</p>
        
        <p>The persona of Victor Bal sounds a new note in Bush's writing, and represents a startling gain in poetic authority. Paring down and concentrating his vision, he has created in <i>The Genre of Silence</i> a work that bears grim and memorable testimony to the dark side of the twentieth century.</p>

        <h4>6. Wesley and Linda</h4>

        <p>Bush calls "Are There Still Wolves in Pennsylvania?" "A poem sequence in two parts for two voices"<a href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a>, and even in its radio version it's a poem for voices rather than a play or a drama. What characterises a play is interaction between characters, an interaction that generates an action. But much of the point of "Wolves" lies in the absence of any verbal interaction or exchange between its two speakers, in the striking way in which speech fails to generate action. Form and theme are scarcely separable, in fact. The characters' thought-streams alternate and occasionally interweave, but never so as to break the insulated nature of their existences for us. Thus, "Wolves" might be described as a double dramatic monologue. If, however, there's no action here, there's still a progression of sorts: the poem is heuristic, it advances through a series of revelations. Yet even then the revelations benefit only the eavesdropping listener/reader – the characters remain unrelieved, occupying the same mutual positions at the end as they did at the beginning, fixed in an essentially static world.</p>
        
        <p>Wesley and Linda are a childless American couple approaching middle age. Wesley is a Vietnam veteran who was invalided out of the army when he was wounded. (The position and shape of his scar – "this star shaped / scar on my left shoulder" – calls up the United States flag and suggests the way in which Vietnam scarred the national consciousness.) Many of Wesley's comrades died, leaving him guilty about still being alive. He's a compulsive hunter, and one reason for his hunting trips seems to be his "need not to be / scared", to face the darkness that still frightens him. Sitting by his campfire, he can imagine that he's back in 'Nam. The "evil yellow / slant eyes" on the edge of the night are those of both Disney wolves and the Viet Cong. His hunting is at once propitiation and self-punishment. He focuses the whole American obsession with guns. He kills "a small grey / whitetail / deer, not even carrying horns", and when at the poem's end we find that at the centre of his torment lies the memory of shooting a fleeing Vietnamese who turned out to be a sixteen year-old girl, the deer acquires a sharper retrospective significance. He's aware of the old Indian idea that drinking the blood of your victims enables you to take on their spirits, but the spirit of the Vietnamese girl is one that he would like to get rid of and cannot. Tied, willy-nilly, to the wheel of fate, Wesley seems condemned to go on repeating his crime. His despairing final words invite us to see his personal predicament as representative:</p>
            
        <blockquote>
        what makes me cry<br/>
        is: what is it<br/>
        in us that longs so<br/>
        <br/>
        to bring down<br/>
        a running thing<br/>
        as if to<br/>
        just see if we can?
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Wesley's obsession has placed his relationship with his wife in jeopardy. Linda has a lover, and takes the opportunity of Wesley's shift-work to fulfil assignations. She thinks he's unaware of her adultery, but we find him outside her lover's trailer at midnight, toying with the idea of shooting either the two of them or himself. Crouching there with his shotgun, he has himself become the predatory creature in the dark that earlier he feared – himself the wolf in Pennsylvania. This ironic duality, in which he's both killer and victim, is laid bare skilfully and memorably in the poem.</p>
        
        <p>Since in Linda we have a female persona whose gender and sexuality are fundamental to her conception, "Wolves" inevitably takes Bush further in his explorations than either of his Widows poems. The speech of both Wesley and Linda is American demotic, and it contains a minimum of overt poetry: it's interesting to note, however, that what poetic language there is is given to Wesley. It's as if Bush has decided that Linda should represent the reality principle, Wesley the dreamer. After Wesley's opening speech, in which he meditates playfully on his "star-shaped scar… scar-shaped star", calling it (in words reminiscent of Sylvia Plath's "Cut") his "Little wrinkled seam", Linda's first speech arrives with almost brutal force: "The times / he fills / his head with this / crap." Linda's femininity exacts no compromises from her language. She reflects on the love-making of husband and lover in speech that's bluntly and authentically contemporary. Bush finds in her a toughness and levelness of gaze that owes nothing to gender stereotypes. To her, Wesley, surrounded by the traditional toys of the macho male – rifles, cartridge belts, knives – is just a kid.</p>
        
        <p>Since the poem's form requires that the characters reveal themselves (or one another: Linda reveals Wesley no less than he reveals himself), it's inevitable that Bush grant them his usual objectivity of vision. Thus, Wesley's capable of thinking himself through to the trauma at the heart of his condition without benefit of a psychoanalyst. Revealing that in his recurrent nightmare the Vietnamese girl he shot turns into an old woman and invites him to make love to her, he declares: "I don't need no Dr Freud or / goddam V.A. shrink to / work this out". But his self-knowledge is without virtue: he remains trapped in the past, unable to live expansively in the present. As for Linda, she has acquired insights into the functioning of modern democratic societies that indicate just how limited one's freedoms are. She puts the headaches from which she increasingly suffers down to the high voltage power lines which pass close to their house. Wesley ridicules her fears, but she insists that he simply cannot allow himself to believe that the country and way of life for which he fought and continues to suffer could knowingly lay her open to illness and neurosis:</p>
            
        <blockquote>
        it would break his heart surely><br/>
        to believe that all<br/>
        of that and all of<br/>
        this too was for<br/>
        <br/>
        nothing, like everything<br/>
        you ever tried or did after<br/>
        the war was cursed. As if<br/>
        what put them power lines<br/>
        <br/>
        up outside our window and<br/>
        what sent him off into<br/>
        that jungle wasn't just<br/>
        the same damn uniform thing.
        </blockquote>            
        
        <p>Like the poetry of Victor Bal, this speech of Linda is fluent, although (again as was the case with Bal) its fluency is (at least for the reading eye) countered by the way the phrasing is broken across the line-endings. It's not literary speech, yet Bush has persuaded it to generate a perception of conclusive resonance (these are Linda's last words in the poem). Earlier on, I used the term "heuristic" in describing the form of "Wolves", but it would be true to say that in this poem sequence Bush has simply allowed his mask of the moment, Linda, that perceptiveness which characterises all his personae.  </p>

        <h4>7. Conclusion</h4>
        
        <p>Writing in persona is an adventure both in experience and in language. It furnishes a test of a poet's powers of empathy with lives and modes of being that differ from his or her own, and of his or her powers of creating styles appropriate to those lives. The variety of experience in Bush's persona poems is considerable. His contemporary masks include miners, a hill farmer, widows and an American working-class couple; his historical masks Ulysses and an ill-fated Russian poet; and there is in addition the mythic mask of "Drainlayer". Each of these figures elicit from him an appropriate style. At one end of the range we find the American demotic of Wesley and Linda: speech shaped (I imagine) by the dual pressures of naturalism and the medium for which the piece was conceived. It’s a hard thing for a poet who delights in eloquent and chiselled language to curb his instincts, but Duncan Bush does it when necessary. At the other end of the range there is the magniloquent utterance of "Drainlayer". In between, a variety of styles, often mixing the idiomatic and the literary.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout these poems, however, one factor remains constant. That is that their speakers are always presented so as to call forth from a reader sympathy rather than criticism. A persona may include in his or her meditation information about himself or herself that's personally unflattering, but it never outweighs the appeal to sympathy which the poem makes. There is in Bush's output, for example, no equivalent to Browning's "My Last Duchess". That's Bush's personae are fundamentally sympathetic seems to me a corollary of that objectivity with which they view their own lives and predicaments. Were they deluded or self-deceiving, we would inevitably think less of them.</p>
        
        <p>That Bush views the persona as a key weapon in the armoury of a poet dissatisfied with the poetry of the first person is apparent in the following extract from a letter (dated 27.1.1991) which I received from him after writing the above:</p>
            
        <blockquote>
        I think I decided a long time ago that certain poets I admired – Plath, Lowell, Berryman: the 'confessionals' – represented a dead end not only in terms of poetry but in a human sense as well. 'Open heart surgery' as Berryman referred to it. (And look how they all ended up…) I also disliked (and still do) the 'occasional' poem, the slightly random published collections of so many delicately-suffering poetical egotists, who really do still believe that their personalised 'sensitive' responses are an adequate measure of the problems of the world they live in.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Tennyson and Browning would have agreed, I imagine, that a recourse to personae enables poets to bite off and masticate more of the world than otherwise they might. Duncan Bush's comments, however, carry a political and moral charge that declares their contemporaneity. They are also provocative, questioning whether a poet content with the restricted perspectives of a single self and its poetic corollary – a single lyric voice – can hope to encompass more than a small corner of the incorrigibly plural world of human experience.</p>
        
        <p>Bush's work vitally demonstrates the continuing serviceableness of the persona poem. But even as one admires his achievement to date, one has to recognise that as yet he has colonised only a small area of what is an enormous space. His first novel <span class="title">Glass Shot</span>, with its complex Welsh cowboy narrator, represents a perfectly natural development, and shows him exploring for the first time, provocatively and excitingly, an unsympathetic persona. But to discuss that book is beyond the remit of this essay: suffice it to say that from the dark space of the subconscious the strangest voices will seductively whisper in a poet's inner ear.</p>
