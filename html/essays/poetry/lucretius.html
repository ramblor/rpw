    <h3>Lucretius: Scourge of Superstition</h3>
    <h4>(Unpublished essay)</h4>

    <p>
        In January 1417, rooting about in the library of an unidentified German monastery, the ex-principal secretary to the lately deposed Antipope John XXIII came upon a long-submerged masterpiece. The book – or, more precisely, codex – was Titus Lucretius Carus's philosophical poem <span class="title">De Rerum Natura</span> – usually translated <span class="title">On the Nature of Things</span> – and the finder was Poggio Bracciolini, humanist and part-time book-hunter. Lucretius died in his fifth decade around 55 B.C., but his philosophical ideas anticipate in remarkable ways modern science's understanding of the physical world. In <span class="title">The Swerve: How the Renaissance Began</span> (2011), Stephen Greenblatt claims that the rediscovery and subsequent translation and dissemination of <span class="title">DRN</span> played a key part in kick-starting the Renaissance. Some reviewers accused Greenblatt of overstating the importance of Lucretius's re-emergence, yet the poet's claim to an eminent position in intellectual history can scarcely be denied. For William Harris, "Lucretius stands out as the first and last Roman philosopher worthy of the name"; for Gevin Giorbran, "Lucretius in my mind is a great example of how science often fails to acknowledge its heritage and philosophers".
    </p>
    <p>
        Lucretius was a disciple of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, none of whose written works has survived. Remarkably, however, <span class="title">DRN</span>, did: and one is entitled to wonder if its survival is bound up with the fact that Lucretius chose poetry as his medium rather than prose. I will come to Lucretius's debt to Epicurus in due course: I wish to start by observing that it was inevitable that an account of the Nature of Things would have something to say about religion, and here Lucretius has proved controversial in all eras in which Epicurean ideas have been discussed. To my own way of thinking, and despite their significant ideological differences, Lucretius and William Blake pair up as doubles partners on one side of a poetic/philosophical tennis net on whose opposite side stand Dante and Milton. Whilst the question of which side to support depends on one's ideological allegiance, there can for me be only one choice – Lucretius and Blake.
    </p>

        Dante and Milton are poets who start out from theological <i>donnés</i> – Dante with the tripartite afterlife division of Roman Catholicism, Milton with the Genesis creation myth. Dante casts himself as judicious assigner of punishment and reward to humanity, Milton as justifier of the ways of God to men. Both poets produce works to which the doctrine of sin is central, where energy characterises devilry and the fallen realm of hell and its inhabitants whilst inertia or stasis characterises the higher realm of heaven. 
    </p>

        Never one to hide his light under a bushel, Blake the Romantic appointed himself corrector of Milton's errors. Begun around 1789, a date notable for reasons other than the poetic, <span class="title">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</span> inverts the myth of the fall. Recasting the story from <i>his</i> point of view, the Devil contends that Satan, or Energy/Imagination, lord of Hell, was the original archangel and that it was Messiah or Reason who rebelled, fell "and formed a heaven of what he stole from the abyss". Messiah (Jehovah, the Old Testament divinity) is devoid of creative powers and is dependent upon Hell/Energy to supply the universe with ideas. Milton's trinity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost is masculine/abstract and lacks the feminine principle wherein productive fecundity is located. At the heart of Blake's programme is his perception that the body and sexuality must be rehabilitated: for Christianity, piggy-backing on Platonism, has propagated the pernicious doctrine that soul is superior to body and will alone survive it (a tricky notion to say the least, since the torture of human beings in Dante's <span class="title">Inferno</span>, as in earlier versions of Hell, invariably requires the persistence of bodies to make it possible). Blake's emphasis on the vital life of the body gives rise to such Proverbs of Hell as "The lust of the goat is the bounty of God" and "The nakedness of woman is the work of God". 
    </p>

    <p>
        Writing the best part of two millennia before Blake, Lucretius declares his poetic/philosophical allegiance in the invocation to Venus which opens DRN:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Then doth the spring her glorious days disclose<br/>
        And the releast, life-giving westwind blowes.<br/>
        Thy power possessing first birds of the ayre<br/>
        They thy approach with amorous notes declare,<br/>
        Next when desires the savage heard incite<br/>
        They swim through streames, and their fat pastures slight<br/>
        To follow thee, who in seas, rivers, hills<br/>
        In the birds leavie bowers, and in greene fields<br/>
        Instilling wanton love into each mind,<br/>
        Makst creatures strive to propagate their kind.<br/>
        <span class="indent"> (Lucy Hutchinson's translation, Book I. 11-20)</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Venus, Roman goddess of love, personifies the energies of desire - <i>lepore</i>, driving all creatures in spring to copulate and multiply. In a more recent translation, C. H. Sisson renders this word as "delight", as did Dryden before him. For Lucretius, as later for Blake's Devil, "Energy is Eternal Delight". As Stephen Greenblatt puts it, all of animal creation, humans included, partake in "a vast process of world-making" that is "essentially erotic".
    </p>

    <p>
        Over against Venus stands Mars. Lucretius pictures the god of war throwing himself on the goddess's belly, smitten and surrendering; yet Venus must in turn surrender to Mars – their interrelationship symbolises the continuous dissolution of material forms that continuous creation necessitates. For George Santayana, they represent "the two sides of every transmutation, that in creating, one thing destroys another"; for M. D. Moorman, they constitute "an eternally recurrent cycle of beginning and end, alpha and omega, birth and death".
    </p>

    <p>
        Elsewhere in <span class="title">DRN</span>, Lucretius is less enthusiastic about the gods. Whilst they exist and are immortal, their "pure natures are so far from sence / We scarce can reach them by intelligence" (Hutchinson; Book V, 161-2). They inhabit a realm far removed from that of humankind where they concern themselves solely with their own affairs. The notion that they created the universe and everything in it is not only absurd but blasphemous. So peripheral, in fact, are the gods in Lucretius's world-picture that one wonders if he is really a closet atheist who only pays lip service to them as a sop to the credulous Roman masses. He has a low opinion of religion and declares – a view with which Poggio Bracciolini most likely sympathised – that it is the source of impieties. He comes, he declares, to scourge the superstitious. Humanity's need of gods, he thinks, is born of fear and ignorance of the laws of nature. Along with this marginalisation of the gods goes a dismissal of the concept of providence and a rejection of life after death. Soul exists, he allows, but is composed of minute particles dispersed throughout the body and dies when body dies. These are the views of a thoroughgoing materialist. Where Milton and Dante are poets of religious faith, Lucretius is the poet of natural process. Santayana goes so far as to declare that Lucretius's "naturalistic conception of things" produces a work of imagination "greater… than any dramatic or moral mythology". Whilst I doubt that Lucretius would find the persistence of religious belief more than 2,000 years after his death a source of surprise – for he recognised that to live with the awareness that death is absolute demands a mental toughness of which many people are incapable – he would surely find the phenomenon of Creationism risible in a world rich in scientific knowledge.

        Epicurus was born in 342/341 BC on the island of Samos and died in 270 BC. Moving to Athens, he founded his own school there, the "Garden of Epicurus". From its inception Epicureanism had to contend with powerful rival philosophies, notably the Platonic Academy, the lyceum of Aristotle and the Stoic school of Zeno. Epicurus was largely concerned with issues of conduct, but valued the study of physics as a way of counteracting superstition and the widespread dread of vengeful gods. The avoidance of pain was central to his system, but, far from being an invitation to hedonistic excess (an accusation made against him down the centuries by biased detractors), he saw the cultivation of pleasure as going hand in hand with that of wisdom and virtue. Advocating abstention from public life, the pursuit of power and sexual love, he regarded friendship as the safest form of pleasure. Bertrand Russell comments: "It was a valetudinarian's philosophy, designed to suit a world in which adventurous happiness had become scarcely possible." Epicureanism was still flourishing in the third century AD, by which time it might be summarized, according to George Hadzitis, as signifying (1) the doctrine of atomism; (2) the denial of immortality; (3) pleasure as the <i>summum bonum</i> of life; and (4) the concept of divine indifference to humankind.
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Epicurus, says Santayana, was "a saint". Reading <span class="title">DRN</span>, it is hard to believe that Lucretius was anything of the kind. Where Epicurus renounces life, Lucretius embraces it, transforming his founder's quietist philosophy with his passion. Hadzitis writes: "The utter disillusionment, the timid humanitarianism of Epicurus was succeeded by the positive ardour of evangelism." And, one must add, by the beauty and vigour of expression of a major poet. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I have already discussed the theology of <span class="title">DRN</span>; I must now turn to its science. If we take on board the fact that the Latin verb <i>scire</i> means 'to understand, to know' and that the noun <i>scientia</i> means 'knowledge', we can be confident in employing the term 'science' when referring to an age long before the establishment of the scientific method. What Lucretius 'knew', and Epicurus before him, they knew <i>empirically</i> – that is, through the evidence of their senses, by observation and by deduction based upon observation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lucretius's physics may be indicated by a single term: atomism, a doctrine Epicurus inherited from Democritus. Lucretius tells us that the universe is composed of two quantities, atoms (or minute, invisible particles of matter) and space (or void, vacuity). It is easy to verify that objects are made of atoms and space, since they wear away over time, the softest (in which particles are loosely packed) quickly, the hardest (in which they are tightly packed) slowly. Atoms vary in kind, but everything that exists is made of them, from stars to stag beetles. The Epicureans thought atoms immortal and irreducible, but twentieth century physics split the atom and we now know that sub-atomic particles can metamorphose into one another. Among the modern theories that Lucretius anticipates are:
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol class="parens">
            <li><i>the conservation of matter</i>: atoms cannot be destroyed or reduced to nothingness, but, after the death and physical breakdown (say) of an animal, become available for reconstitution in fresh forms;</li>
            <li><i>the nature of the cosmos</i>: Lucretius correctly declares the cosmos to be without centre or bottom, but he also thought it limitless; modern cosmologists imagine it as an expanding finitude;</li>
            <li><i>photons</i>: light particles are exceedingly fine and pass through the spaces in cruder objects, as we can observe, for example, with horn; furthermore, light travels faster than sound;</li>
            <li><i>time</i>: time has no objective existence (as St Augustine would later argue), and is relative (as Einstein would famously show).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Arguably the most important element in Lucretius's physics, however, is the doctrine of the 'swerve' (variously <i>declinatio</i>, <i>inclinatio</i> and <i>clinamen</i>):
    </p>
 
    <blockquote>
        Bodies in a streight line, with their owne weight,<br/>
        Borne down, in the vast space alter their state,<br/>
        When both in an uncerteine time, and place,<br/>
        Suddaine concussions force them to give space;<br/>
        For if they were not thus us'd to decline,<br/>
        Like drops of raine, they all in a streight line<br/>
        Would fall into the vast profunditie,<br/>
        Soe no concursions, nor no touch could be<br/>
        Allowd the principles, and by this way<br/>
        Nature could nothing frame&hellip;<br/>
        (Hutchinson, Book II, 211-220)
    </blockquote>
         
    <p>
        What Hutchinson translated here literally as a compulsion to <i>decline</i> is in modern-day terminology better rendered as a swerve or deflection or, as Susan Mapstone puts it, a "spontaneous and infinitesimally small change of direction". It is these irregularities that cause atoms to collide and give rise to vortices and "compound bodies of matter on a macroscopic scale" – including human beings. As there is no explicit reference to the <i>clinamen</i> in what has come down to us of Epicurus's system, it may be that Lucretius significantly developed the idea. Whilst the <i>clinamen</i> itself cannot be observed, its outcomes may be. Scientists have interpreted it in terms of fluid mechanics (Michel Serres) and non-equilibrium dynamics (Ilya Prigogine). Susan Mapstone suggests we imagine it "as a primary example of the variation in initial conditions necessary for Hendrick Lorentz's famous 'Butterfly Effect'". It is the source of such (limited) free will as human beings possess – constituting for Mapstone "a kind of 'butterfly effect' of the mind".<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Hadzitis writes: "the nature and behaviour of the atom were&hellip; the authentic parallel, in the natural universe, to the individual in the social world".
    </p>

    <p>
        It follows from Lucretius's account of motion that the universe requires no god/gods to bring it into being or prompt its progress. Given the swerve, it is inevitable that nature will produce a succession of forms, simple at first, complex later. Here we may trace a direct line from Lucretius to the chemist P. W. Atkins, who writes: "Once molecules have learnt to compete and to create other molecules in their own image, elephants, and things resembling elephants, will in due course be found roaming through the countryside." Lucretius, that is to say, anticipates evolutionary theory and natural selection. Far from being designed from scratch by some omnipotent and purposeful superbeing, organs such as the eye develop gradually in bodies because their successive manifestations are found increasingly advantageous to survival. It is absurd to believe that nature was created for human use: human beings are products of natural processes and are subject to the perils of existence just like any other animal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Epicurean ideas deliver a counterblast to teleological modes of thought, which is to say those that interpret phenomena in terms of their purposes rather than their causes. Lucretius seems to have been isolated in his own time, with Neoplatonism the preferred philosophy. Later, theologians such as Lactantius and St Augustine attacked him, as was inevitable when their Christian world-view emphasized sin and self-denial and located the good life (for those who played their cards right) on the nether side of the grave. The remarkable seventeenth-century bluestocking Lucy Hutchinson, whose curiosity drove her (while sitting in the nursery) to translate all but around a hundred lines of <span class="title">DRN</span> into heroic couplets, denounced its "Atheisms and impieties", branding Lucretius a "Dog" and a dangerous "Lunatick" and describing his atomic theory as "Casuall, Irrationall" and "foppish"! 
    </p>

    <p>
        But Lucretius, as Hadzitis and Greenblatt show, inevitably proved influential. Virgil and Ovid esteemed him and among the post-classical writers he touched to a greater or lesser degree one may list Marsilio Ficino, Thomas More, Machiavelli, Erasmus, Giordano Bruno, Montaigne, Spenser, Francis Bacon, Hobbes, Dryden, Voltaire, Diderot and Hume. Given that Thomas Jefferson (who owned no less than five Latin editions of <span class="title">DRN</span>) declared to a correspondent who enquired as to his philosophy of life "I am an Epicurean", we should hardly be surprised that "the pursuit of Happiness" appears as a crucial human right alongside life and liberty in the Declaration of Independence. I love and value Lucretius not only because he is a great poet but because his ideas – erroneous though they are in some respects – continue to be as vital and challenging in our time as they were in his own.
