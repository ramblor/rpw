    <h3>Egotist and Camelion</h3>

    <h4>(A talk given to the Colwyn Bay and District Association for the Arts, March 1989; slightly revised)</h4>

    <p>
        The terms Egotist and Camelion - the latter spelt not as it is found in a modern-day dictionary but as a kind of portmanteau word fortuitously and felicitously combining two very different beasts - derive from a famous letter sent by John Keats to his friend Richard Woodhouse on 27th October 1818. He uses them to characterise what he believed to be two different sorts of poet, exemplified by himself and his older contemporary William Wordsworth. I intend first to illuminate these terms; then to ask if they precisely fit Keats and Wordsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the relevant section of the letter:<br/>
        <br/>
        "As to the Poetical Character itself, (I mean that sort of which, if I am any thing, I am a member; that sort distinguished from the wordsworthian or egotistical sublime: which is a thing per se and stands alone) it is not itself - it has no self - it is every thing and nothing - It has no character - it enjoys light and shade; it lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated - It has as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogen. What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no identity - he is continually in for [informing?] - and filling some other Body - The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute - the poet has none; no identity - he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures."
    </p>

    <p>
        It's clear that Keats is contrasting here two kinds of poet and two orders of poetry. His ideal poet projects himself (by courtesy, I think we may say, of the faculty of imagination) into bodies other than his own, bringing back reports upon  how the world looks and feels from the vantage-point of other senses, other limbs, other temperaments and mentalities. Shakespeare, creator of Iago and Imogen, exemplifies this ideal. Over against Shakespeare stands Wordsworth, poet of the "egotistical sublime". Now Keats had enormous admiration for Wordsworth, whom he knew personally, but he didn't shrink from criticising him; and in fact there is another and earlier letter of his that sets out the grounds of his complaint against the older poet. This is dated 3rd February 1818, the recipient J. H. Reynolds. In it Keats declares:
    </p>

    <p>
        "&hellip; for the sake of a few fine imaginative or domestic passages, are we to be bullied into a certain Philosophy engendered in the whims of an Egotist - Every man has his speculations, but every man does not brood and peacock over them till he makes a false coinage and deceives himself&hellip; Poetry should be great &amp; obtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject."
    </p>

    <p>
        The poem of Wordsworth's he picks out to belabour is "The Two April Mornings". This poem, from the second edition of <span class="title">Lyrical Ballads</span>, is one of those portraying the schoolmaster Matthew, who seems to have been based upon one of Wordsworth's teachers at Hawkshead School. In "The Two April Mornings" Wordsworth and Matthew go for a walk together. The elderly man recalls a day thirty years before when, visiting the grave of his daughter, who died at the age of nine, he saw a beautiful young girl - but "did not wish her mine". The poem ends:

        <blockquote>
            Matthew is in his grave, yet now,<br/>
            Methinks, I see him stand,<br/>
            As at that moment, with a bough<br/>
            Of wilding in his hands.
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        Keats comments on this as follows:<br/>
        <br/>
        "Old Matthew spoke some years ago on some nothing, &amp; because he happens in an Evening Walk to imagine the figure of the old man - he must stamp it down in black and white, and it is henceforth sacred - I don't mean to deny Wordsworth's grandeur and [Leigh] Hunt's merit, but I mean to say e need not be teazed with grandeur and merit - when I mean we can have them uncontaminated and unobtrusive."
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, that's pretty plain! Matthew sticks like a fishbone in Keats's throat; he can't swallow him at all. Far from accepting Wordsworth's presentation of the old schoolmaster as a figure of authority and sagacity, Keats regards Matthew as a tiresome and garrulous old duffer! We might say that he objects to the <i>egotism</i> implicit in Wordsworth's valuation of Matthew (which includes his assumption that the reader will accept that valuation), and the <i>sublimity</i> of Wordsworth's statuesque presentation of him.
    </p>

    <p>
        But that is the debit side of the matter: there is also of course the credit side. "I don't mean to deny Wordsworth's grandeur," says Keats, and the older poet's "egotistical sublimity" must be given its positive as well as its negative due. Keats's most sustained account of what he appreciated in Wordsworth comes in his letter to Reynolds of 3rd May 1818. This is the celebrated letter in which he compares life to "a large Mansion of Many Apartments". He describes how, as one gets older, the second chamber, "the Chamber of Maiden-Thought", gradually darkens, and the doors that line its walls are set open. Perceiving them, he writes,
    </p>

    <p>
        "We are in a mist&hellip; We feel 'the burden of the mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them. he is a Genius and superior [to] us, in so far as he can, more than us, make discoveries, and shed a light in them."
    </p>

    <p>
        Keats goes on to say that he feels Wordsworth to be "deeper" than Milton - although he qualifies this compliment by adding that that depth has "depended more upon the strength and gregarious advance of intellect, than individual greatness of Mind" - by which he seems to mean that Wordsworth is a greater intellectual and philosophical poet because of the general advance in philosophy which Western civilisation has made. Now the phrase "burden of the Mystery" or "burthen of the mystery" is a direct quotation from "Tintern Abbey". It appears quite early in the poem. Wordsworth has returned to Tintern after a five year absence. In the second paragraph of the poem he says, however, that the "beauteous forms" of the landscape near the abbey have been in his mind throughout that time. He lists the benefits he believes himself to have had from them - first, "sensations sweet"; then "feelings&hellip; Of unremembered pleasure", to which he feels inclined to credit at least some of the good deeds he has done in the interim. He then goes on:

        <blockquote>
            <span class="indent">Nor less, I trust,</span>
            To them I may have owed another gift,<br/>
            Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br/>
            In which the burthen of the mystery,<br/>
            In which the heavy and the weary weight<br/>
            Of all this unintelligible world,<br/>
            Is lightened:- that serene and blessed mood,<br/>
            In which the affections gently lead us on, -<br/>
            Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br/>
            And even the motion of our human blood<br/>
            Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br/>
            In body, and become a living soul:<br/>
            While with an eye made quiet by the power<br/>
            Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br/>
            We see into the life of things.
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now it seems to me that one could scarcely find a better example of egotistical sublimity than this passage. Wordsworth actually deploys the word 'sublime' in it to describe the most notable gift that he believes he "beauteous form" of nature to have granted him, and, like Keats in his letter critical of Wordsworth, I don't think one can deny the grandeur of the writing. What then is the difference (I mean, as far as Keats is concerned) between this passage and "The Two April Mornings"? One point seems clear: Keats seems more inclined to rust Wordsworth when the sublimity he is expressing is the sublimity of his <i>own</i> experience than when Wordsworth is trying to persuade us of the sublimity of a <i>third</i> person (Matthew, in the instance of the poem he dislikes). Te ore egotistical the poetry, one may even say, the better. One of the interesting things about the Tintern Abbey passage, to my mind, is the way in which the first person singular ("I trust&hellip; I may have owed&hellip;") gives way to the first person plural ("us" and "we"). How are we to understand this shift? One might argue either of two conflicting viewpoints here. The anti-Wordsworthian might say: 'The man's an egomaniac! He actually thinks that people go around having mystical experiences all over the place! What a fruitcake!' The pro-Wordsworthian, on the other hand, might retort: 'See how magnanimous Wordsworth is: he knows that he's describing a rare and beautiful personal experience, but he pays the reader the compliment of including him/her in on it. And even if the reader's never had anything like it, he/she comes to experience it through the poem, which recreates it.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, so much for egotistical sublimity. What of the camelion poet, of whose tribe Keats believed himself a member? I'll start here by remarking that Keats's ideal and touchstone, Shakespeare, is in fact a poetic dramatist. Iago and Imogen come before us on the stage in their physical separateness; they impress their individuality on us by speaking a text and performing certain actions. They possess bodies of their own in the persons of the actors embodying them. In order to create them it was necessary for Shakespeare, the camelion dramatist, to be, in Keats's teasing and audacious paradox, that most <i>unpoetical</i> of things, because a thing devoid of a fixed self, a poet. But Keats isn't a poetic dramatist (except, that is, for <span class="title">Otho the Great</span>, which in any case is a good bit alter than the camelion poet letter); a lyric and narrative poet, his impersonations, or camelion changes, are accommodated within literary forms quite different from those of the five act drama that was Shakespeare's chief medium. In a drama, the characters are free-floating: they stand, as it were, on their own textual feet; but in a narrative poem the poet must tell us what the characters look like and what they do, and their own words (if in fact they speak) are embedded in the ongoing story. What this means is that if Keats is a camelion poet, if he projects himself into bodies other than his own, he can't do it in quite the way that Shakespeare does, because the conventions of the literary genres inside which the two men work are different.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we look closely again at the camelion poet letter, we may see something interesting. As far as punctuation is concerned, Keats is a devil-may-care sort of fellow, and wouldn't get very good marks at the local comprehensive school (or perhaps he would these days&hellip;). He's extremely fond of the dash, and there are no less than five dashes in the sentence going from "A Poet" to "God's Creatures". Well, where the full stop is a separative mark of punctuation, the dash is a connective one, linking statements strongly together, aggregating them. So I suggest that when we read the passage<br/>
        <br/>
        "- and filling some other Body - The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute -"<br/>
        <br/>
        we aren't wrong if we take sun, moon, sea, men and women to be examples of those bodies that the poet takes delight in filling. Keats's friend Woodhouse, to whom this letter was addressed, has left us a fascinating note about the poet:<br/>
        <br/>
        "He has affirmed that he can conceive of a billiard ball that it may have a sense of delight from its roundness, smoothness and very volubility, and the rapidity of its motion."<br/>
        <br/>
        In case you are a little puzzled by the word "volubility" here, let me quote one of the meanings given for it in <i>The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i>:<br/>
        <br/>
        "2. The capacity of rolling, revolving, or turning round; aptness to rotate about an axis or centre 1594."<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now it is entirely typical of Keats that he should have imagined the billiard ball to be <i>sensible</i> - that is, to be capable of sensation - and that it took pleasure in its sense-experience. The critic John Jones in his excellent book <i>John Keats's Dream of Truth</i> has extended the billiard ball's range of sensations to take in the following:<br/>
        <br/>
        "the delicious feel of the cloth, the cue's touch, the clack against its brothers, the kiss of the cushion, the deep snuggling repose of the pocket"<br/>
        <br/>
        and has imagined the billiard ball enjoying its own perfect sphericity - "globèd" like the peonies in the "Ode on Melancholy". Now Keats may well have been teasing Woodhouse  when speaking of the sensible billiard ball, but this fascinating little example nevertheless pushes us in the right direction. For Keats's strongest suit as a camelion poet consists precisely in his capacity to empathise - not just to <i>sym</i>pathise, or feel <i>for</i> the objects and creatures that he contemplates, but more than that, to <i>em</i>pathise, to get <i>inside</i> their skins and feel <i>with</i> them. <i>Feel</i> is indeed the crucial word, and when Keats famously exclaims in a letter to Benjamin Bailey of November 1817 "O for a life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts!" he is giving quintessential expression to his own poetic bent.
    </p>

    <p>
        In his poetry he demonstrates this capacity pretty much from the start. Here is a passage from "I stood tip-toe upon a little hill", completed in December 1816:

        <blockquote>
            How silent comes the water round that bend,<br/>
            Not the minutest whisper does it send<br/>
            To the o'erhanging sallows; blades of grass<br/>
            Slowly across the chequered shadows pass -<br/>
            Why, you might read two sonnets ere they reach<br/>
            To where the hurrying freshnesses ay preach<br/>
            A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds,<br/>
            Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,<br/>
            Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the stream,<br/>
            To taste the luxury of sunny beams<br/>
            Tempered with coolness. How they ever wrestle<br/>
            With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle<br/>
            Their silver bodies on the pebbly sand.<br/>
            If you but scantily hold out the hand,<br/>
            That very instant not one will remain -<br/>
            But turn your eye and they are there again.
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        One can see that Keats is still learning his trade here: there is the somewhat mawkish and intrusive reference to reading sonnets, and there is the awkward "ay" in the sixth line - a bit of padding for the sake of the metre. But the notion of the water preaching a natural sermon is a happy and imaginative one, and the minnows themselves - well, I can't see how Keats's handling of them could be bettered for visual and tactile precision. It may seem at first sight to be merely a piece of description, the poet observing the behaviour of some fish, but I want to suggest that Keats has had to project himself imaginatively into the minnows in order to return with the booty of sense-experience which he not only gives us, but through which we can in turn experience something of what it might be like to be these particular creatures. He imagines the minnows enjoying both heat - the sun's warm rays on the surface of the stream - and coolness - the modest temperature of the water running past them. Thus the reader is drawn into complicity with the fish, and invited to nuzzle into the gravel on the bottom of the stream. Notice how the key words "nestle&hellip; bellies&hellip; pebbly" are strongly pattered through assonance and consonance, so that a simulacrum of fish-flesh rubbing against small smooth stones is created. No sooner has this been done, however, than Keats compels us abruptly to pull back to arm's length: we are observers again, and it is our outstretched hands that cause the fish to shoot from one location to another.
    </p>

    <p>
        When it comes to the creation of human characters in his narrative poems, we have to admit, I think, that Keats is some light-years away from matching the achievement of his idol Shakespeare. He  can boast no Iago and no Imogen, no Pistol and no Portia. In his best narratives, "The Eve of St Agnes" and "Lamia", the main characters - Porphyro and Lycius - are little more than the cardboard representations that the plots require. Such character interest as there is lies in the thoughts and experiences of his female figures, Madeline and Lamia - and, I should perhaps add, Dame Angela, who is Madeline's old nurse. We must therefore conclude, I think, that there are definite limits to Keats's powers as a camelion poet. And it is at this point that one may begin to question the complete aptness of the absolute contrast between the egotistical poet the camelion poet that Keats makes in his letter.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first major cause of doubt arises from the recognition that Wordsworth himself is a considerable creator of character in his narrative poems and lyrics. Could it really have taken a slighter intelligence and a slighter knowledge of the human heart to create the old shepherd Michael, say, or Betty and Johnny, mother and son in the comedy "The Idiot Boy", than it took to create Madeline or Lamia? Indeed, one would have to recognise, I think, that of the two poets Wordsworth is plainly the more realistic and resonant creator of character. One must concede, therefore, that there is an element of the camelion in the elder poet's poetic sensibility. He is in face quite capable of writing in persona - and in feminine persona at that. In "The Emigrant Mother", a poem written in 1802, he imagines the feelings of a woman driven from France and compelled to leave behind her own son behind, as she watches an English child at play: here is the first of eight verses:

        <blockquote>
        'Dear babe, thou daughter of another,<br/>
        One moment let me be thy mother!<br/>
        An infant's face and looks are thine<br/>
        And sure a mother's heart is mine:<br/>
        Thy own dear mother's far away,<br/>
        At labour in the harvest field:<br/>
        Thy little sister is at play; -<br/>
        What warmth, what comfort would it yield<br/>
        To my poor heart, if thou wouldst be<br/>
        One little hour a child to me!'
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        By no means first-rate Wordsworth; but the writing has poignancy, and certainly shows Wordsworth interested in emotions other than his own (although, given that he abandoned his French mistress and child when he returned to England under the pressure of revolutionary events, he may have feelings something like the emigrant mother's himself when observing children at play). 
    </p>

    <p>
        The converse of this argument is that one also has to recognise the egotist in Keats. Self-absorption isn't a frequently encountered quality in his verse, but it is there. Here is a prize exhibit - one of the most astonishing sonnets, for my money, in the English poetic canon:

        <blockquote>
        I cry your mercy, pity, love - aye love!<br/>
        <span class="indent-10">Merciful love that tantalizes not,<br/>
        One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,<br/>
        <span class="indent">Unmasked, and being seen - without a blot!<br/>
        Oh, let me have thee whole - all, all be mine!<br/>
        <span class="indent">That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest<br/>
        Of love, your kiss - those hands, those eyes divine.<br/>
        <span class="indent">That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast;<br/>
        <br/>
        Yourself - your soul - in pity give me all,<br/>
        <span class="indent">Withold no atom's atom or I die;<br/>
        Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,<br/>
        <span class="indent">Forget, in the midst of idle misery,<br/>
        Life's purposes - the palate of my mind<br/>
        Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!</blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        No prizes are offered for guessing Keats's favourite part of the female anatomy. The sonnet was probably written in October or November 1819, and of course expresses the desperation of Keats's feelings for Fanny Brawne, to whom he had become secretly betrothed. The poem's intense egotism is, as we might expect, an egotism of <i>emotion</i> rather than the egotism of thought which Keats accuses Wordsworth of falling into. Few readers, I imagine, would find anything of sublimity in it, unless perhaps it were a sublime embarrassment. This poem relates to the better-known
        "La Belle Dame Sans Merci", written earlier in April 1819, where the figures of the pale knight and the enchantress who enslaves him are pretty obviously analogues for himself and Fanny. "I cry your mercy" is astonishing in its accommodation of the maximum of emotional incontinence - an incontinence at once coercive and servile - in that most intricately formal of poetic shapes, the sonnet. Needless to say, there is nothing in the least "unobtrusive" in this poem!
    </p>

    <p>
        My conclusion is a simple one, then, and it's this: that a poet may be both - albeit at different times - an egotist and a camelion. Keats, the camelion poet, is sometimes an egotist; Wordsworth, the egotist, is sometimes a camelion. And indeed, doesn't it sound like mere commonsense to allow that a galloping self-centredness might be one of the masks which the camelion poet will at times put on?
