    <h3>"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"</h3>
    <h4>[Unpublished essay, written 1984, slightly revised]</h4>

    <p>
        I have long since lost count of the number of times I have read "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" or read about it, have pondered it or discussed it with other people. Yet, as I sit down to look at it again, it invites me into an interior which possesses no less freshness than I seem to remember it possessing when I first encountered it. This freshness is bound up with many things, with, for instance, the poem's attractive blending of pathos and irony; but central to it now seems the elusiveness of its language: "Prufrock" does not so much refuse to declare an intention (for the refusal of an intention might itself be understood as an intention of sorts) as elicit from the reader a recognition that an intention, being far too crude a thing for a poem to have, is no part of its business. Its irreducibility, its unparaphrasableness, these properties are creative (though not constitutive) of a modernity which makes light of the fact that it is a septuagenarian. Now more than ever it seems to evade the busy voice of the interpretative critic: gently but insistently to slip away from efforts to take hold of it and to make an ideal order of it. Its complex purity seems best served by a reading aloud that will responsively clothe its straggling lines and blocks of print in continuously shifting tones of voice: business-like, playful, languid, self-deprecatory, amused, world-weary, exasperated, bored, wistful – and more besides. And, of course, there can be no such thing as a finally authoritative reading aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
        The kinds of difficulty that "Prufrock" presents to the interpretative critic may be indicated by its opening lines:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="indent-10">Let us go then, you and I,</span><br/>
        When the evening is spread out against the sky<br/>
        Like a patient etherised upon a table;<br/>
        Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,<br/>
        The muttering retreats<br/>
        Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels<br/>
        And sawdust restaurants with oyster shells:<br/>
        Streets that follow like a tedious argument <br/>
        Of insidious intent<br/>
        To lead you to an overwhelming question&hellip;<br/>
        Oh, do not ask, 'What is it?'<br/>
        Let us go and make our visit.<br/>
        <br/>
        <span class="indent-10">In the room the women come and go</span><br/>
        Talking of Michelangelo.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The first two lines carry us along smoothly enough, but the third brings us up short. How are we to understand "evening" in terms of "a patient"? There is an initial disjunction between evening "spread out <i>against</i> the sky" and the patient "etherised <i>upon</i> a table": viewed horizontally, the patient would be seen against whatever background an operating theatre provides. Then: are we to think of a draped patient, so that we might envisage (say) a bar of darkly coloured cloud lying low down on the horizon in the aftermath of sunset? or are we to think of the patient naked, so that we night envisage (say) a stratum of flesh-pink cloud lit by the dying sun? Since Prufrock is in the city, it may be that "evening" refers synechdochically to the cityscape at nightfall, so that the patient's supine body might imply the silhouette formed by a horizon line of buildings of a uniform height when the sun has dropped behind them, lighting the lower sky in a contrasting pastel shade. The difficulties involved in coming to a visual understanding of the simile have, not surprisingly, led critics to accounts of it that sacrifice precision of correspondence. D. E. S. Maxwell, declaring that it is "a metaphysical conceit, an intellectual or 'wit' image", says (in <span class="title">The Poetry of T. S. Eliot</span>):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "It is not altogether successful, for synthesis fails to result from the yoking together of the disparate ideas – we can see the relationship between the evening and Prufrock, who <i>is</i> the etherised patient, but are not convinced that this is sufficient to justify their being linked so violently together."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        But can we so readily assume that it is Eliot's purpose to aim for a "synthesis" between "disparate ideas"? Perhaps we are <i>intended</i> to find the simile difficult and provocative – <i>un</i>assimilable, even. What could the fact that Prufrock's attempt at a simile is "not altogether successful" (if indeed it is) tell us about his command of language? No more can I accept the assertion (advanced by critics beside Maxwell) that "Prufrock <i>is</i> the etherised patient": far from being "etherised", Prufrock strikes me as being exceptionally conscious and self-conscious. An etherised person would not worry away at language with Prufrock's baffled persistence, nor would he be capable of the recognitions to which Prufrock attains (see below). In arguing in this way I am conscious, however, that I am myself implying a unified and consistent persona for Prufrock: and I am far from convinced that this is a desirable procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
        The early simile is only the first of a series of devices and stratagems by means of which clarity of expression and precision of meaning are circumvented in the poem. The streets, hotels and restaurants seem, at first sight, to be sufficiently <i>there</i>; but a reader attending closely may well want (1) to ask: when is a street "<i>half</i>-deserted"? (2) to observe that "The muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels" contrives obscurely to populate the hotels with intangible presences (one notes the teasing playing-off of "nights" against "one-night"; and (3) to sense in "sawdust restaurants" not simply a reference to the practice of scattering sawdust on floors, but a gesture at the flimsiness of the fabric of these structures. Thus the language has, despite its confidence of tone and movement, achieved a certain obliquity of statement (human life exists in this city, but its existence can only be suggested by the most enigmatic and elusive of verbal means) by the time one reaches:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Streets that follow like a tedious argument <br/>
        Of insidious intent<br/>
        To lead you to an overwhelming question&hellip;
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The physical journey doubles a mental journey of increasingly discomforting implications; the intensifying series of epithets ("tedious&hellip; insidious&hellip; overwhelming") going along with the sharpening of focus delivered in the progression from "argument" to "intent" to "question". What we find in the first ten lines, then, is a blurring of distinctions between psyche and city, between "inner" and "outer": the division between perceiver and perceived has dissolved: the psyche finds it own processes mirrored in the cityscape, while the city has become internalised as a mental entity. Life in the city leads you to "an overwhelming question", but
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Oh, do not ask, 'What is it?'<br/>
        Let us go and make our visit.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        D. E. S. Maxwell's comment on the unidentified question – "it is justifiable to think of it as being the same question asked in <i>The Waste Land</i>: 'What shall we ever do?'" – seeks to crystallize what it is the poem's strategy to leave unstated. In so far as streets that suggest ongoing mental processes lead one to this question, it is a question which might relate to the purposes of both minds and cities. But we must not ask what it is: we are advised to keep walking without questioning the meaning of our journey, to keep thinking without allowing our thoughts to formulate questions pertaining to the lives we are living.
    </p>
    <p>
        The city and the psyche: to this pairing must be added a third term, making a triad: language. It is language which enacts the interpenetration, language that at once allows the double-natured journey to take place and renders it dauntingly – and absurdly – complicated. The "overwhelming <i>question</i>" implicates language in the proceedings along with mind and world: the difficulties Prufrock has with the mind and the world are inextricably bound up with the difficulties he has with language. Later he will be brought exasperatedly to cry:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        It is impossible to say just what I mean!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Eliot's preoccupation with language, his consciousness of the problems attending significant speech, is, throughout his poetic career, nothing if not consistent. In "Burnt Norton" he will write:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="indent">Words strain, </span><br/>
        Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,<br/>
        Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,<br/>
        Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,<br/>
        Will not stay still.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Already in "Prufrock" language testifies to the force of this statement. Grammar and syntax, all linguistic conventions (Eliot perceives) are checks on the natural life of language, for language is inherently anarchic: words, he senses wish to escape the burdens and tensions to which the human need for communication, to seek meaning and significance through them, subjects them. Eliot's poetry encapsulates a gradual collapse of language towards and into unintelligibility (<i>The Waste Land</i>, "The Hollow Men"), a collapse from which it will recover with difficulty (<i>Ash Wednesday</i>) to attain the unsteady platform of <i>Four Quartets</i>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        It is impossible to say just what I mean!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        might be Eliot's own exclamatory motto. Whatever communication he manages with us in his poems is achieved in spite of this admission. The appalling difficulties that Prufrock encounters in attempting to say what he means (never mind the "just"!), means that <i>meaning</i> (of the order to which he would aspire) is beyond him. If this is so, it seems less true to posit that he is frightened of facing up to the "overwhelming question" (though this is a reasonable assumption to make) than to posit that he lacks the capacity to formulate it: it escapes him because language escapes him. The "question" therefore reflects back upon the limits of his mind and language: not only are mind and world problematic entities, but so is the language (<i>his</i> language) in which he seeks to define and elucidate them. No wonder he prefers to keep moving!
    </p>
    <p>
        Somewhere he has been, or somewhere he is going,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="indent-10">In the room the women come and go</span><br/>
        Talking of Michelangelo.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The elusiveness of these lines epitomises both Prufrock's difficulty in interpreting his world and our difficulty in interpreting the poem. The women are there, "<i>in</i> the room", and yet they "come and go": talk of Michelangelo – <i>talk</i> – supplies the organising centre of there mysterious arrivals and departures – it is language that here provides human motion with a point of focus. Since we are told nothing of the detailed, substantial nature of the women's talk of Michelangelo, it must therefore follow that we can identify it neither as trivial nor significant. <i>To whom</i> might it be either? The vague, facile couplet with its trite rhyme cannot, for instance, inform us whether Prufrock has overheard this talk (perhaps catching the floating name of the painter), or whether he is imagining a situation in an imaginary room. Certainly the women have the tenuousness of figures in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
        "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" is, as a number of critics have suggested, a pastiche, an assemblage of pieces of poetry rather than a through-composed narrative or argumentative whole. But the complete assemblage cannot be said to 'add up to' the sum of its parts; some, in their uncertainty, imply subtraction rather than addition. If "Prufrock" is not (after Laforgue) a narrative unity, then (runs much critical thinking) some other principle must be found to hold it together. In C. K. Stead's view (see <i>The New Poetic</i>) "its coherence depends on consistency of feeling, not on a fixed sequence of idea or event". This "consistency of feeling" is the consistency of "a state of mind" belonging to an "immature" young man. Having decided that the poem is coherent, Stead goes on to criticise its fourth paragraph for "a loss of firmness: the attempt to fix a mood slides into vacuous gestures". Here is the paragraph in question:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="indent-10">And indeed there will be time</span><br/>
        For the yellow smoke that slides along the street<br/>
        Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;<br/>
        There will be time, there will be time<br/>
        To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;<br/>
        There will be time to murder and create,<br/>
        And time for all the works and days of hands<br/>
        That lift and drop a question on your plate;<br/>
        Time for you and time for me,<br/>
        And time yet for a hundred indecisions,<br/>
        And for a hundred visions and revisions,<br/>
        Before the taking of a toast and tea.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In criticising these lines as he does, Stead is surely criticising the poem not in the terms in which it presents itself, but for failing to conform to his own conception of it. Is it not the case that there <i>is</i> no "consistency of feeling" in the poem? Its tone shifts from paragraph to paragraph, from line to line. Prufrock, like the unnamed young man in "Portrait of a Lady", is 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Doubtful, for a while<br/>
        Not knowing what to feel or if I understand&hellip;
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        If there are "vacuous gestures" in the quoted paragraph they are constituent qualities of the language which composes for us 'J. Alfred Prufrock', the name teasingly prefixed to this collection of pieces of poetry which are not 'of a piece'.<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> If there is a principle which holds "Prufrock" together, it is the quasi-musical principle of repetition – repetition of phrases and verbal formulae, repetition of language-rhythms – and variation. The world, the mind and its language – the constituents of our triad – are together compelled to go through the same motions. In this process meaning is problematic, words shimmer with the indeterminacy that Prufrock feels life possesses: in that last-quoted paragraph the movement of smoke, the putting on of a face, acts of murder and creation are events invested with an equal significance – or rather, with an equal absence of significance. Whatever happens – "indecisions" (paralysis of intellectual motion), "visions and revisions" (where the transcendent potential of the first term is mockingly retracted in the second, and where <i>revisions</i> also suggests that perception is subject to the corrective reflections of language) – is seen to be preliminary to, and subordinate to, the social authority of the ritual tea-party. The language which permits Prufrock to declare "There will be time&hellip;" is the same language that tells him that what there is time <i>for</i> empties "time" of meaning. Set against the familiar and limited concreteness of "a toast and tea", "time" for Prufrock is a word that resonates with awesome potencies, for it invites the mind into endless speculations upon the possibilities of life; but in subjecting "time" to incantatory repetitions he dulls its impact upon him, reducing it to signifier purely, to an arrangement of phonemes that chimes in his brain like a clock until it admits him no passage through itself to a world of enriching action. (Compare, from <i>The Waste Land</i>, "HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME".) In short, it is because everything is possible in time that for Prufrock nothing is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To say that Prufrock (or 'Prufrock') is able to articulate certain recognitions (as the city offers him "certain half-deserted streets" to walk in) is to say that the poem – despite "It is impossible to say just what I mean!" – is heuristic in its movement. Prufrock, in making his triple journey, makes whatever limited recognitions he, and his language, are capable of. It is ironic, of course, that these recognitions must, due to Prufrock's nature, be negative. Observing that "There will be time&hellip;" and asserting "I have known them all already" lead him to ask "And would it have been worth it&hellip;?": to which the answer comes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        No! I am not Prince Hamlet&hellip;<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The poem, accumulating piece by piece (pieces which lean heavily upon the conjunctions "And" and "For" for their internal glue), advances rhythmically and inevitably to a recognition which can only serve to confirm the pointlessness of that advance. "Prufrock" is thus at once heuristic and inertial. This ironic paradox is particularly finely articulated in the two paragraphs that begin: "And would it have been worth it&hellip;?" For example:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="indent-10">And would it have been worth it, after all,</span><br/>
        After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,<br/>
        Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,<br/>
        Would it have been worth while<br/>
        To have bitten off the matter with a smile,<br/>
        To have squeezed the universe into a ball<br/>
        To roll it towards some overwhelming question,<br/>
        To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,<br/>
        Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all!" – <br/>
        If one, settling a pillow by her head,<br/>
        <span class="indent-10">Should say: "That is not what I meant at all.</span><br/>
        <span class="indent-10">That is not it, at all."</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The paragraph accumulates by means of prepositional phrases whose weariness already implies the defeat to come, flourishes a sardonically energetic knot of infinitives only to founder, like a stranded boat, on the sandbank of what, though it is only a conditional, stands as an emphatic rebuff. As this paragraph finds itself, at its end, back where it started from, so does the whole poem: Prufrocks's triple journey, although it can reveal his predicament, cannot show him a way out of it. It is, in words from <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, a
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Journey to no end<br/>
        Conclusion of all that<br/>
        Is inconclusible
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        as is the journey made, severally and collectively, by all Eliot's major poems. And yet, if Prufrock achieves no life-enhancing insights, he may at least be said by the end of the poem to
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        know the place for the first time.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        What, finally, he 'knows' is conveyed in the poem's closing lines:

        <blockquote>
            I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.<br/>
            I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.<br/>
            <br/>
            I do not think that they will sing to me.<br/>
            <br/>
            I have seen them riding seaward on the waves<br/>
            Combing the white hair of the waves blown back<br/>
            When the wind blows the water white and black.<br/>
            <br/>
            We have lingered in the chambers of the seaweed<br/>
            By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br/>
            Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        C. K. Stead comments that the imagery of the last six lines "seems to contain, latent if not realized, a vision of ecstatic sexual fulfilment, frustrated by the voices of reality". Prufrock's experiences seem to me to be better characterised as a dream than a vision. The mermaids come to him in sleep or daydream, they are wholly denizens of imagination. The alternation in the verb tenses between "I <i>shall</i> wear" and "I <i>have</i> heard", between "I do not think&hellip; they <i>will</i> sing to me" and "I <i>have</i> seen" affirms the barrier that exists between the stuff that dreams are made on and the stubborn world into which one must daily awaken. It is the latter realm which, ironically – and counter-intuitively –"drowns" the Prufrockian dreamer, not the realm of dream itself. Yet even in dream the girls are seen to be "riding <i>seaward</i> on the waves" – away from him. Thus I cannot accept Stead's suggestion that Prufrock's "vision" is one of "ecstatic sexual fulfilment". Even in dream the mermaids seem beyond his reach, creatures that tantalize rather than fulfil, filling him with a wistful longing for something that he can never attain, cannot even hope to attain. It has been suggested that de Nerval's siren in "El Desdichado" – 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        J'ai rêvé dans la grotte où nage la sirène
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        – was a source for Eliot's mermaids. Whether this is so or not, it is to my purpose to quote this line, for it serves to point up the intense romanticism – indeed, <i>late</i> romanticism – of the closing lines of "Prufrock". Prufrock's predicament, in fact, is the <i>fin de siècle</i> predicament – the predicament of the sensitive and retiring aesthete who finds the world of 'reality' inferior to the world of dream. At this juncture we may return to the view that the poem is a pastiche, an assemblage of pieces of verse expressing not only different tones but written in various <i>styles</i>. Its final movement (marked off in the text by three asterisks) sets one style against another, the style of "No! I am not Prince Hamlet&hellip;" against that of the lines on the mermaids. The first of these is anti-romantic, logopoeic (in Pound's terminology), a language that allows a series of limiting self-recognitions to spiral down to the point of acerbic self-dismissal. The second is a romantic style, melopoeic and phanopoeic, expressive of a yearning and saddened aestheticism. This clash of styles is enacted even in the lopsided couplet
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I grow old&hellip; I grow old&hellip;<br/>
        I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        where the self-regarding sadness of Falstaff's words is inescapably bracketed with the language of self-mockery. The effect of this final contrast of styles is to leave Prufrock imprisoned in a decadent romanticism (his language mirrors his plight, we observe) which he has seen for what it is – enervating and futile. He condemns himself to the beach in the perfect knowledge that he will never see what he most wants to see: for the mind and the world are in this at odds with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
        The end of the poem sums up for Eliot two inextricable recognitions – the attractiveness, and the inadequacy, of romantic language. Its insufficiency is regretfully articulated in the romantic passage itself:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br/>
        By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br/>
        Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Romantic language makes for an exquisite suffocation. Looking back from the vantage point of this ending, we can see other passages that express the
        <i>fin de siècle</i> feeling. Consider:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="indent-10">And I have know the arms already, known them all –</span><br/>
        Arms that are braceleted and white and bare<br/>
        (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)<br/>
        Is it perfume from a dress<br/>
        That makes me so digress?<br/>
        Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Compare, from Dowson's "Ad Manus Puellae":
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I was always a lover of ladies' hands!<br/>
        <span class="indent-10">Or ever mine heart came here to tryst,</span><br/>
        For the sake of your carved white hands' commands;<br/>
        <span class="indent-10">The tapering fingers, the dainty wrist.</span><br/>
        <span class="indent-10">The hands of a girl were what I kissed.</span><br/>
        <br/>
        I remember an hand like a <i>fleur de lys</i><br/>
        <span class="indent-10">When it slid from its silken sheath, her glove; </span><br/>
        With its odours passing ambergris:<br/>
        <span class="indent-10">And that was the empty husk of love.</span><br/>
        <span class="indent-10">Oh, how shall I kiss your hands enough?</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Of course there are differences, the chief of which is that Dowson (or Symons or Yeats in the same period) is <i>inward</i> with the emotion whilst Eliot is (through Prufrock) at once inward and detached, observing and interrogating sentiment. This is the essence of Eliot's modernity – that he has his cake and eats it. It establishes him at a level of poetic intelligence utterly beyond the reach of the poets of the nineties. Yet Eliot is plainly their inheritor (as High Kenner has said he is the inheritor of Tennyson and Swinburne). The effect of the end of "Prufrock" is to suggest that Eliot is bidding farewell to the language of nineteenth-century verse: the poem initiates his life-long quest for modes of poetic utterance that will express uncompromisingly the new century.<br/>
        <br/>
        Coda: "I have measured out my life with coffee spoons."<br/>
        <br/>
        It seems to have gone unremarked that this line is ambiguous. Is Prufrock saying that he has doled out his life in spoonfuls as one doles out sugar – in disconnected, perhaps reluctant and parsimonious amounts, unwilling to throw his 'whole self' (has he a 'whole self' to throw?) into any one experience or undertaking? Or is he saying that the triviality and narrowness of his life might be expressed (as one 'measures one's length') by laying, head to tail, a large number of coffee spoons: which we may then fantastically imagine advancing towards and disappearing over the horizon? Eliot, even at his most disarmingly concrete, may prove wittily and teasingly elusive.

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>
        <a id="note1"></a><sup>1</sup> Michael Edwards has perceptively identified one of the problems that "Prufrock" throws up as being "that of deciding what <i>could</i> damage writing of this kind". (<i>Eliot/Language</i>, Aquila 1975. This little book is the best single thing on the poetry I have read.)<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a id="note2"></a><sup>2</sup> C. K. Stead comments:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Pound's dislike of the Hamlet passage is easy to understand. It defines in sharp abstractions a Polonius who bears little relation to the shadowy uncertain identity which is the voice of the poem. It is the abstract delineation of a mind, not a living image. The clever young literary man has again taken command."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Alas, Stead comprehensively misses the two crucial points about this passage: (1) that the rhythmic movement of the poem leads inevitably and rightly to "No! and the series of negative definitions that follow it; and (2) that the poem's pastiche of styles enacts in language the very instability of the "uncertain identity" he professes to find there.
    </p>
