            "<span class="title">Jewel and Thorn</span> is well-written, pacy and exciting. It is a considerable achievement and promises much."<br/>

        <p class="review">
            "Fans of elvish bildungsroman and classic adventure stories will appreciate the elevated diction and enigmatic characters. Although the book's not short, even reluctant readers may be drawn in by the scenes of gambles gone awry and battles with crayfish. The cliff-hanger ending promises a second book in the saga."<br/>
