    <h3 class="title">THAT FOOL JULY (2003)</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
        <span class="title">That Fool July</span> is a chapbook of translations from the major twentieth century Welsh poet T. H. Parry-Williams. Williams was born in the heart of Snowdonia and often reflects the bleakness of the mountain terrain. He writes in a plain, unadorned language, eschewing classical Welsh verse-forms and the consonant chiming of <i>cynghanedd</i>. His preferred forms are the sonnet and the rhyming couplet.</p>

    <h4>Conviction</h4>
    <blockquote>
        I stood, like a god, on the corner where<br/>
        <span class="indent-line">The old Red Trail to great Snowdon's summit</span><br/>
        Turns left, level and stony, and there<br/>
        <span class="indent-line">Like one who can boldly make fate submit, </span><br/>
        I rolled a rock down the rough cliff-face<br/>
        <span class="indent-line">And watched as it galloped, lickety-split, </span><br/>
        With a rabble of pebbles that joined the race<br/>
        <span class="indent-line">As it knocked them down along with it. </span><br/>
        I knew very well that no one but I -<br/>
        <span class="indent-line">The god, though the fact's unworthy of mention -</span><br/>
        Determined the shape of its destiny<br/>
        <span class="indent-line">When I set the simple stone in motion;</span><br/>
        But I realised after it was gone<br/>
        That I wasn't a god - I was the stone.
