    <h4>Childhood Sonnets 11: The frogs</h4>
    <blockquote>
    Of the passengers on the bus, more than one stared<br/>
    accusingly at the biscuit tin I carried -<br/>
    it might have been the holes punched in the lid.<br/>
    A number of the frogs inside were paired-<br/>
    it was spring - the male squatting on the female in<br/>
    the orthodox position from <i>Rana Sutra</i>.<br/>
    <br/>
    How sharp the light that morning seemed, lancing<br/>
    into the lab through those tall panes of glass.<br/>
    Mr Wiseman showed me the killing jar<br/>
    and paid out threepence a frog. The boy I was<br/>
    completed the transaction imperturbably,<br/>
    unfussed about that cold amphibious night.<br/>
    <br/>
    Older, squeamish now, it is the trapped frogs I see,<br/>
    blinking in the merciless morning light.

        <h4>From reviews of <span class="title">Autobiographies and Explorations</span></h4>
        <p class="review">
            "Carefully constructed and with a measured pace of voice, there is a confident versatility and intelligence at work in these tight variations on a form."<br/>
            - Tim Woods in <i>Poetry Wales</i>
        </p>
        <p class="review">
            "Poole's dedication to the form results in a <i>tour de force</i> of sustained poetic effort, but these are sonnets for the post-modern age: experiment, rather than tradition, is the driving force behind this collection."<br/>
            - Edmund Cusick in <i>Bulletin of the Welsh Academy</i>
        </p>
        <p class="review">
            "He is a perceptive, thoughtful, wide-ranging-in-ideas poet; one whose saying is limpid, whose tone is quiet. As a sample of the excellence of his perceptivity I would draw attention to the childhood sonnet 'Girls', for the wonderful recapturing of boyhood's view of girls with its perfect youthful masculine naivety."<br/>
            - William Oxley in <i>Acumen</i>
        </p>
        <p class="review">
            "subtle and impressive, driven by a searching intelligence."<br/>
