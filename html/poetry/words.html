    <blockquote>
        Sleeping by myself is curious.<br/>
        the strangeness isn't the product<br/>
        <span class="indent">of your not being here -</span><br/>
        of the cold fact of disconnectedness -<br/>
        but your refusal in our severance<br/>
        <span class="indent">to be utterly away! </span><br/>
        <br/>
        You persist on the edges of perception,<br/>
        <span class="indent">a distraction -</span><br/>
        an imaginary sound that turns my head,<br/>
        a shadow half-glimpsed in mirror-glass,<br/>
        the wraith of a perfume in the room.<br/>
        <br/>
        Tonight I shall douse the light,<br/>
        clamber into the emptiest of sheets,<br/>
        <span class="indent">close my eyes, </span><br/>
        and fold myself away into your absence.<br/>
