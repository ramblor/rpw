        God! I'm a repetitious bore:<br/>
        it's I, me, my, mine all the time -<br/>
        but this too I have said before.<br/>
        <br/>
        <i>I love myself! How I adore<br/>
        the chime of every ego-rhyme!</i><br/>
        God! I'm a repetitious bore.<br/>
        <br/>
        I'd roll about for evermore,<br/>
        pigging it in the ego-slime;<br/>
        but this too I have said before.<br/>
        <br/>
        <i>Listen to me! You'll soon deplore<br/>
        the egotistical sublime!</i><br/>
        God! I'm a repetitious bore.<br/>
        <br/>
        I scratch my ego like a sore,<br/>
        a villain in a pantomime;<br/>
        but this too I have said before.<br/>
        <br/>
        <i>I'm the first person's troubadour!<br/>
        My life's an ego-paradigm!</i><br/>
        God! I'm a repetitious bore.<br/>
        But this too I have said before.<br/>

        <p class="review">
            "In <i>Natural Histories</i> he has brought together a range of poems which demonstrate the finest aspects of his writing, including an urbane turn of phrase, an infallible sense of rhythm, and a rich word-hoard that is the mark of an experienced poet&hellip; a most impressive collection by a well-equipped poet who knows what he want to say and how to say it."<br/>
