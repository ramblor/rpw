    <h4>Shadow</h4>
    <blockquote>
        I'm the dark side of you<br/>
        that's visible in sunlight.<br/>
        <br/>
        You pretend not to know me,<br/>
        ignore your parasite<br/>
        <br/>
        while I orbit about you,<br/>
        a flat satellite,<br/>
        <br/>
        dream of tangibility,<br/>
        a third dimension of height<br/>
        <br/>
        till, deftly, I melt into you<br/>
        as day turns to night.<br/>
        <br/>
        Then you melt into me.<br/>
        Now my wrong is your right.

        <h4>From reviews of <span class="title">Camelion</span></h4>
        <p class="review">
            "<i>Camelion</i> may be a 'collection of poetic fictions' as the blurb tells us, but they are fictions rooted in historical figures. Nero, Tut-Ankh-Amon, Li Po, Zahir-ud-Din Muhammad Babur, Giordano Bruno, Alexander Selkirk, Kuchuk Hanem, Corvo, Hitler, Helmut Kohl, Jason, Electra, Delius, Peter Warlock. The list isn't complete, but at random it presents a feast of stories as rich as Herodotus&hellip;<br/>
            <br/>
            There is an intellectual brilliance and playfulness to Richard Poole's imagination which may only appeal to a certain kind of reader – it would have infuriated Larkin – but rewards repeated readings&hellip;<br/>
            <br/>
            The philosopher's <i>nothingness</i> – Sartre here – remains the unifying theme throughout, metaphorically brought to life in the closing poem, 'Nothing', with the wonderful line: 'I'm the keyhole that invited the invention of the key'. There is both humanity and humour here, the metaphor brilliantly revealing Poole as poet before dry theorist."
            <br/>
            - William Bedford in <i>Acumen</i>
