    <strong>Abandoned Slate Quarry, Nantlle</strong>
    <br/>
    <blockquote>
    1.<br/>
    <br/>
    Carved bodily out of the mountain's dark bone,<br/>
    the emptiness is absolute.<br/>
    <br/>
    Bared, the dressed terraces of slate drop away,<br/>
    buttressing the silence.<br/>
    <br/>
    Below, clouds are mirrored<br/>
    in the penetrating deep blue eye of a still lake.<br/>
    <br/>
    2.<br/>

    Blasting the slate from ancient faces,<br/>
    cleaving the flat slabs,<br/>
    <br/>
    the quarrymen split fragments<br/>
    of themselves, and loosening<br/>
    <br/>
    uncanny emanations, felt the abrupt<br/>
    resonance of bone and bone.<br/>
    <br/>
    3.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now, beneath the same blue slate<br/>
    they once worked, the quarrymen<br/>
    <br/>
    rest. Earth breaks down their substance<br/>
    into earth. Alike impassive, remote,<br/>
    <br/>
    cemetery and quarry<br/>
    reciprocate a durable repose.
